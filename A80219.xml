         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Therefore wee were willing to communicate our affaires to the Churches of Chriſt diſperſed through the World, and Godlineſſe it ſelfe doth command us to declare unto posterity, as much as in us lies, what waters wee have paſt through, and in what furnaces of fire wee have beene heated, that

               <p n="2">2.

               <p n="3">3. Whileſt he was thus buſied, his brother <hi>Boliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi> invades him, being excited by his more vigilant mother, to that wickedneſſe: at firſt he loſt his blow; in regard his ſword by a ſudden amazement, fell out of his hand, but thoſe who were hired as coadjuters in this wickedneſſe, inflamed him with new rage and fury, ſo he repeats his ſtroak and eaſily kills his diſarmed bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who patiently receives his wound.

               <p n="5">5. But when the revenging eye of God, could not longer bear the deaths, and Martyrdomes, the Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and croſſes of his own, he declared a dreadfull example of his wrath upon <hi>Drahomira;</hi> for on that place where the Miniſters bones lay unburied, the earth opened of it ſelf and devoured <hi>Drahomira</hi> alive, with the Chariot and thoſe that were carried in it, which place is now to be ſeen before the Caſtle of <hi>Prague.</hi>

Mr. <hi>John Huſſe</hi> was conſtituted his Succeſſour, Profeſſor in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cademy, a man of an unblameable life, and famous for his zeale.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And foraſmuch as he had long before, that all orders were diſſolute, and none did his office, the King, Biſhop, Citizen, Clergy, Nobles, onely purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing covetouſnes, pride, drunkenneſſe, luxury, and all manner of wickedneſſe, having an occaſion put into his hands as from above, he ſet upon the worke pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly,

And indeed ſo long as he ſhot his darts againſt ſecular men, he was highly eſteemed off amongſt the Divines, as one out of whoſe mouth the Holy Ghoſt ſpake: but as ſoone as he began to thunder againſt them alſo, their minds being altered, they cryed out that he was mad, and the Devils Agent.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thoſe that write of him tell us, that the firſt complaints againſt him, were put up by certain of the Nobles unto the King (to wit, <hi>Wenceslaus</hi>) whom the Pope preſented unto the German Princes, as a ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh perſon unprofitable unto the Empire, hateful (yet not infamous in Hiſtoryes) becauſe of his unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to execute his Buls, and his indulging the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, againſt his will) and required him to forbid <hi>Huſſe</hi> of his turbulent preaching.

               <p n="4">4. But when in the year following, this ſame <hi>Huſſe</hi> much more ſharply reproved the Coveteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Luxury, and Sacriledges of Spirituall perſons &amp; the Arch-biſhop, requeſted of the King the ſame which the Nobles did before.

There returned out of England the ſame year, (1400) <hi>Ierom</hi> of Prage, bringing with him the writings of <hi>Wickliffe,</hi> which came into the hands of many and was received by many, with good appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation: ſome indeed approving of them (among whom this <hi>Huſſe</hi> was chief) others diſliking and damning them, eſpecially the <hi>Academians,</hi> who (as we have formerly ſaid, did flock from divers Countries.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In the year 1404, two Engliſh men, Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelours of Divinity (one <hi>Iames,</hi> and <hi>Conrade Cad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delaurgh</hi>) came to Prague, and being entred in the Vniverſity, they began to move diſputes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Popes Supremacy, and the like; but ſhortly after were prohibited by publick command. They therefore (becauſe that which was forbidden unto men, was lawfull for the walls to receive,) cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be painted in the Parlor, where they Lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; with the conſent of their Land-lord, the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Chriſts Paſſion on the one ſide, and the pomp of the Pope, and Cardinals Court, on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther oppoſit; and of this picture when <hi>Iohn Huſſe</hi> made mention in his preaching, as of a true Antitheſis betweene Chriſt, and Antichriſt, great numbers of people came thither to view it.</p>
               <p n="7">7. In the year 1408. May 24. the Articles of <hi>Wickliffe</hi> were again examined and condemned, by forty Maſters and an infinite number of Batchelors;

               <p n="8">8. <hi>Iohn Huſſe,</hi> when he ſaw the Vniverſity-men of Germany ſo ſtrongly to ſide with the Pope, deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſomething was to be done to reſtrain their inſolency, he made an Oration in a great concourſe of people (in Carolin Colledge) aſſerting that the plurallity of voices belonged to the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> who were natives, and not to the <hi>Germans,</hi> who were ſtrangers: for although <hi>Charles,</hi> from the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution granted three voices unto ſtrangers, the fourth unto the Bohemians, in reſpect of their forcity, who then ſtudied learning, in his laſt pattin he explicated his minde, that the cuſtome of the Pariſian Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity ſhould be obſerved. Now it doth abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear in France, ſtrangers have but one Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage, but the home-bred have three, the Germans being angry for this, Appealed to King <hi>VVenceſlaus,</hi> the Bohemians do the ſame, but the King after a yeares protraction, decides the Cauſe for the Bohemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, in the year 1409. the 27. of Sept. the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans interpreting this a diſgrace, leave Prague, and going into Miſina (a neighbouring place) and there give occaſion to the founding of Lipſick, &amp; Erphord, Schools: in the mean time, the Bohemians created by voices, <hi>Iohn Huſſe</hi> their Rector.</p>

There are extant ſome Bohemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Rimes compoſed by one of the common people, in which that unlearned cenſor of books was witti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly jerkt, for being made an Arch-biſhop, then he ſtudied letters, but <hi>Huſſe</hi> in that time wrote a tract concerning the reading of Hereticall books, and inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a particular diſpute for the defence of <hi>Iohn Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liff,</hi> concerning the holy Trinity which they alſo burnt.</p>
               <p n="10">10. In the year 1411. when Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> the 23. ſounded an alarum againſt the King of Naples, he gave Indulgencies to thoſe that would take up arms for the Church: One that ſold thoſe toys came to Prague, and publickly in the pulpit divulged thoſe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities. It ſo hapned that in three Churches ſome op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed them, aſſerting the Pope of Rome muſt bee Antichriſt, who brought miſery upon the Chriſtians, and ſtirred them up to mutuall wars.

               <p n="12">12 In the meane time the Pope cites <hi>Huſſe</hi> to appeare at Rome, who in regard of the diſſwaſion of the Vniverſity and nobility, did not appeare, Pope <hi>Iohn</hi> 23 in the yeare 1413 in <hi>Iune</hi> did interdict their celebrating of Maſſe, in regard of the preſence of Huſs a contumacious offender, upon this when hee ſaw the Magiſtrates rage, and the common people divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into contrary factions, and all things to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed, he of his own accord leaves <hi>Prague,</hi> and

               <p n="2">2. In the meane time there is a great concourſe of people, their Wives, Children, Kinsfolkes, and friends crying and mourning. The Conſuls onely daughter comes, wringing her hands and throwes her ſelf down at her fathers feet, beſeeehing him to ſave her husbands life. But her father harder than any rock, commands her to leave weeping, telling her ſhe knew not what ſhe asked. [What ſaith he, cannot you have a worthier husband than this is] ſhe, perceiving by theſe words that it was impoſſible to perſwade him, riſeth. [Oh father ſaith ſhe, you ſhall never more eſpouſe me to any.] So beating her breaſt, and tearing her hair ſhe followeth her husband, with the reſt of the people.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When the Martyrs were brought to the bankes of <hi>Albis,</hi> they are taken down from the carts, and while the Ferries are preparing (for there was not then a bridge over <hi>Albis</hi> as there is now) they with loud voices call heaven &amp; earth to witneſs their innocency, and take their laſt farewell of their wives, children and friends, exhorting them to conſtancy and zeale,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:169711:21"/> and cleave rather to the word of God than mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, and at laſt pray for their enemies, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend their ſoules to God. Then being taken into the boats, and brought into the middle of the river, they are caſt in with their hands and feet bound toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and are drowned.

               <p n="4">4. The Conſuls daughter, ſeeing her husband, leapt into the river, and claſping him about the middle, endeavoured to ſave him from drowning. But ſhee being not able to wade, by reaſon of the depth, nor hee to unloſe himſelfe, and having ſwallowed down much water ſhe ſank, and was drowned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with her husband.

Whereupon the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop returned him to the Collonel who again ſent him back to the Biſhop, who after he had made him his ſubject of mirth &amp; ſcorn for all that night; on the day following being Sunday, they were all brought unto the ſtake and faſtned with ſuch a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod that theſe poor champions of the Truth (as near as the invention of their malice could diſpoſe of them) were placed in the lap of <hi>Wenceſlaus.</hi> And when the Biſhop did admoniſh them to abjure that part of the Sacrament in which the Cup is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the faithfull Curat made anſwer for him and his. <hi>God forbid, we had rather ſuffer under a hundred deaths than deny a truth ſo clearly revealed in the Goſpell.</hi> On this the executioner was commanded to give fire unto the faggot, who immediately with the flame did ſend them up a gratefull ſacrifice to the Almighty, <hi>Wenceſlaus</hi> being the laſt that gave up the Ghoſt.

               <p n="2">2. This was done on the 9 of March, in the year of our Lord 1422. which being diſcovered by the bloud, was the occaſion of a mighty Tumult. For the flowing of the bloud did cauſe ſuch a confluence of

               <p n="1">1. VVE are now come to declare the Schiſm of thoſe men, who did profeſſe the name of <hi>Hus,</hi> and how the greater part of them did by degrees degenerate, and at laſt did perſecute the faithfull: They all had a zeal, according to the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Hus</hi> their Maſter, to oppoſe Antichriſt; But when by his remarkable death, they were deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of a diſcreet and couragious Captain, who ſhould contain the incenſed people within the bounds of rule and order, it ſo came to paſſe, that they were diſtracted into divers opinions, and nouriſhed moſt grievous diſſentions among themſelves. For the Commonalty of the people, and the greateſt part of the Clergy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bent only upon the Cup, and from thence called Cuppeirs in the Story of Security, neglected the other documents of Mr. <hi>Hus.</hi> But the Thaborites (amongſt whom <hi>Wenceſlaus Lorenda,</hi> and <hi>Nicolas Epiſcopius,</hi> two excellent men, were moſt eminent, with ſome few others) did preſſe the purity and ſimplicity of his doctrine, in all the Articles and Ceremonies thereof. On the one ſide it was cryed up, that the Rites of the Church were not eſſentiall, on the other ſide all Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition was cried down: neither were there wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſome diſguiſed men, who to promote the cauſe of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:169711:26"/> the Pope and Emperour, did kindle new flames of diſſention, and did ſtir up the hatred of the people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the profeſſors of the pure doctrine, traducing them by the hatefull name of <hi>Piccardines;</hi> for you are to underſtand, that they called the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> by a nick-name, <hi>Piccardines,</hi> who not long before being forced from France, did ſit down in Auſtria, and were now famous for the infamy of the fouleſt of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks: So diſtractedly did diſorder &amp; confuſion man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage al things, I told you before how zealous <hi>Zealine</hi> was made ſhorter by the head. There were alſo ſome found, who ſo poſſeſſed <hi>Ziſca,</hi> Commander in chief of the Thaborites, that he ſhould unite himſelf with the Calixtines, who were only and altogether for the Cup, and perſecute the Piccardines, as he did the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, with fire and ſword.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the year 1427, the Adminiſtrators them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, of the Conſiſtory of Prague, Mr. <hi>Przibram,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Procopius de Pelſna,</hi> being at that time Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the Univerſity, with <hi>Peter de Mladoniowitz,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Krzoſtan</hi> a Phyſitian, were firſt impriſoned, and afterward baniſhed for the profeſſion of the pure doctrine. It was no wonder indeed, if the intreſts of Rome, and her Agents had not utterly diſſolved them, ſo diſagreeing amongſt themſelves: but the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full goodneſſe of God did otherwiſe diſpoſe it, which knew ſo wiſely to temper the folly of men, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther friends nor foes had any place left for the glory of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:169711:26"/> Triumph; for as often as <hi>Caeſar</hi> (taking advantage of their diſſentions) did grow upon the Bohemians with his Armies, they alwayes (a happy peace being ſuddenly concluded) did defend the common cauſe with common Arms. <hi>Ziſca</hi> and <hi>Procopius</hi> leading their men, and managing their affairs, and God giving them ſucceſs, and wonderfull victories.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Emperor therefore with the Pope finding that they could profit nothing by the ſword, did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy their cunning, and having called a councell at Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilea, in the year of our Lord 1432. they moſt curteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly invited the Bohemians to a peaceable tranſaction, promiſing them to give them ſatisfaction on the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick faith, as they themſelves ſhould deſire. Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners were therefore ſent unto this councell, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom the moſt eminent was <hi>John Rokizane</hi> of Prague, and <hi>Nicolas Epiſcopius</hi> of the Tabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens both famous Divines. Of the nobility of that Kingdome, they made choice of <hi>Procopius</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of the Taborens, and <hi>William Raſtka</hi> Baron of Poſtupicz and others, who being honourably en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained, and asked what their demands were, they offered four articles, deſiring that either the Councell would grant them, or allow them by argument to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the righteouſneſſe of them: The Articles were theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That the uſe of the Cup may be reſtored to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:169711:27"/> the people, and that the ſervice of the Church might be in their own tongue,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That the Clerks or Miniſters might uſurp no authority in ſecular things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That the word of God might be freely prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and without diſturbance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>That there may bee publicke puniſhment for publick offences.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The Legate of the Pope demanding if that they had not any more articles to propound, becauſe he heard it reported that they affirmed that the Order of the Monks were from the Divells, <hi>Procopius</hi> made anſwer, from whence otherwiſe could they derive their Original, which was inſtituted neither by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarks nor Prophets, neither by Chriſt nor the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="5">5. After this Delegates were deputed who on both ſides, for forty days together, diſputed on the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles. And when the Bohemians could not be confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they were drawn at laſt to a friendly compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>John Rokizane</hi> with the hope of an Arch-Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prick, being corrupted himſelf, and ſeducing others of the Commiſſioners, the affairs were ſo carried, that the Bohemians promiſed to return unto the obedience of the Church of Rome, and to obſerve all their traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and their rites, the uſe of the Cup being among other demands excepted. Theſe four Articles were
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:169711:27"/> afterwards named the agreement, and Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners were ſent into Bohemia from the Councell and <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who were to declare that the Bohemians were received into the boſome of the Church, and were again to be eſteemed as deer children. Heere a Parliament being called, <hi>Rokizane,</hi> Rhetorical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough, did expound himſelf, how according to his deſire he obtained theſe things, in the fighting for which ſuch an exceſſe of bloud was made and the Kingdome was made ſo great a Ruine. He was now pleaſed to ſtile the Pope and <hi>Caeſar</hi> in ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther language then heretofore, when he called them the Whore and the Beaſt.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It gave an occaſion of great grief to many, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to the zealous Thaborites, to depart in this manner from the Diſcipline of <hi>Hus,</hi> and to return in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the profeſſion of the Church of Rome. They in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured what they could to reſtrain them, and at laſt they had recourſe unto armes again, in which the Thaborites were overthrown, and their defeat was ſo remarkable, that after this they defended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves only by the Word of God and patience. This hapned in the year of our Lord, 1434.</p>
               <p n="7">7. In the year following at a publick convention, <hi>Rokizane</hi> was ſolemnly choſen Arch-Biſhop, but when the Emperour endeavoured to hinder from the ſolemn Rites of conſecration (peradventure becauſe he did diſtruſt a man ſo deceitfull) he being impa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tient
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:169711:28"/> that he was thus deluded, did again make a new faction, and bitterly inveighed againſt the unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of the Emperor, and the domineering of the Pope of Rome, &amp; for fear of <hi>Caeſar</hi> he for the ſpace of 3 years, withdrew himſelf from Prague, for <hi>Sigis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund</hi> not long after died, &amp; ſo did his ſucceſſour <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus</hi> within two years ſpace, having left his ſon <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſlaus</hi> behind him, who had his education in the Court of <hi>Frederick</hi> the Emperor.</p>
               <p n="8">8. In this time and intervall of Government, and eſpecially not long after the ſudden death of <hi>Ladiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> when <hi>George Podebrade</hi> did ſucceed him whom <hi>Rokizane</hi> did infinitely poſſeſſe, was that of the Prophet truly fulfilled, Manaſſes <hi>ſhall devour</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim, <hi>and</hi> Ephraim Manaſſes, <hi>and both ſhall be againſt</hi> Juda. For the Pope did rage againſt <hi>George Podebrade,</hi> and the Calixtines, who were thoſe that uſed the Cup, with prohibitions, cenſures, and with curſes, and they as eagerly did inveigh againſt the Pope and Monks, but the truly faithfull were on both ſides oppreſſed.</p>

               <p n="1">I. IN the year of our Lord, 1444, the Reliques of the Thaborites were utterly oppreſſed by force and fraud, for <hi>Rokizane</hi> by himſelf and others
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:169711:28"/> moſt flatteringly alluring them unto him, did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that he was ready to turne to them, if they could hold out unto him a purer Truth, than what he did teach: neither in this cauſe did he intend to make either himſelfe or any of his, Judge, but that the Aſſembly of Divines in their publique meeting ſhould determine of it. To this the Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borites conſented, and relying on the goodneſſe of their cauſe they appeared at the aſſembly, where af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many Debates Arbitratours being choſen that ſhould pronounce the definitive ſentence, which was ſo to be confirmed by the Authority of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly that neither part for the time to come ſhould ever again provoke one another, but forthwith ſhould join themſelves to that on which the Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors ſhould pronounce the greateſt truth to be.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It was ſo carried (for <hi>Rokyzan</hi> had on purpoſe betrayed the Thaborites to this aſsembly) that the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrators did pronounce the greateſt truth to be on <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kizan</hi>'s part: and the poor &amp; ſimple Thaborites found themſelves circumvented by deceit: but not daring to go againſt the Agreement, promiſed to perform it, in the Rites thereof. But returning home, when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed to reform their Church, <hi>George,</hi> who then exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed the Kingly power, comming down with his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, did cloſely beſiege their City, and ſtruck ſuch a terror on it, that the Citizens giving it up unto him, did with it deliver their Miniſters into his power, who
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:169711:29"/> throwing them into Dungeons at the Caſtle of Pode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brad, and at Lititz, he killed many of them, <hi>Lupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> with ſome others, having addreſſed themſelves to <hi>Rokizane.</hi>

               <p n="1">I. BUt when the Bohemians for certain years, did in vain deſire, that their Arch-biſhop might be inveſted in his Dignity, having for that purpoſe ſent ſo many Legates unto Rome, and the Pope refuſed to do it, unleſs that <hi>Rokizane</hi> ſhould renounce the Cup: The Cardinall of Saint <hi>Angelo</hi> being alſo ſent to Prague, in the year 1448. was commanded under the pretence of Treaty, to call for the Agreement on the four Articles, and to bring them with him: which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving gotten into his hands, he ſtole away with them, but was quickly overtaken, and enforced to return them. <hi>Rokizane</hi> finding himſelfe thus deluded, re-aſſuming new hatred againſt the Pope, when out of the Revelations, and the Prophecy of <hi>Daniel,</hi> he had ſhewed that the Pope was the great Antichriſt, and we, ſaith he, vnleſſe we ſhall withdraw our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience from him, are but a miſerable and a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned crew, he proceeded and told the people that the law of Chriſt, and not the agreement on the Articles were to be held for the rules of Religion, that all
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:169711:29"/> things from the ſea of Rome were polluted, foule, and to be forſaken, and Religion to be taken againe from the fundamentalls of the Apoſtles. In this way he perſevered, ſo thundering againſt Antichriſt that many believed him to be another <hi>Huſſe,</hi> and that the hope of the new Reformation did ſhine forth againe.</p>
               <p n="2">2 But when he put no hand unto the worke, the more forward amongſt his Auditors (amongſt whom one <hi>Gregory</hi> was the formoſt, a Nobleman and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew unto <hi>Rokizan</hi>) having joyned in counſells together, they repaire to <hi>Rokizan,</hi> diſcover the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes of their Conſcience and deſire counſell of him.

But when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine and againe being now more conſiderable in their numbers they importuned him, that he would deferre any longer to exhibit in deeds what he taught in words, he replyed, that it was a buſineſſe of great importance, in which nothing but with deliberation was to be c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. In the mean time <hi>Rokizane</hi> did attempt what he could againſt the Pope, and conſented with the Church of <hi>Greece.</hi> For when the dec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ee of the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod at Florence was proclaimed, in which the Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians were the ſecond time to be abalienated from
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:169711:30"/> the Church as Hereticks. There was a convenſion of the States at Prague, and a Synod of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, in the yeare 1450. in which by the advice of <hi>Rokizane,</hi> but by the common conſent of all, an appeale was made to the Greeke Church, and Ambaſſadours ſent with letters to Conſtantinople. The Greekes received the Heads of the Doctrine from them, and rejoyced in their mutuall conſent, and letters in the teſtimony thereof, being returned to the Bohemians, they confirmed them in the faith, having made a promiſe that they would ordain them Miniſters for their Church. The Letters were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed in Parchment, and ſealed with waxe of a red colour, with the ſubſcription of the Patriarch, and the chiefeſt of his Biſhops, which being after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward committed to the preſſe, are yet extant to be ſeen. But when theſe things afforded but a lingring hope, <hi>Rokizane</hi> did again incourage his, and gave them new hopes of a Reformation, ſuddenly to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear: for taxing divers abuſes, he ſaid: We <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nly now do grow on the out-ſide, but ſhortly ſome will appear, who from the depths ſhall draw forth the foundation of true religion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. When in this manner for ſeven long yeares, hee delayed to give ſatisfaction to the minds of ſo many pious men, being againe demanded his advice, hee ſaid. That he now had ſeriouſly obſerved, and conſidered all things, and could not yet find what
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:169711:30"/> to determine on, unleſs there ſhould be a ſeparation aſwell from thoſe that uſed the cup in the Sacrament, as from the Papiſts themſelves, for all things did abound with abominations, and he found the evill irrecove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. <hi>Lupatius</hi> alſo delivered himſelfe after the ſame manner: when it was replied to <hi>Rokizane,</hi> Let therefore a ſeparation be made, we will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thee for our Captaine, we will worſhip thee for our Doctor, we will follow thee for our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he made anſwer. You offer mee too great a burden to undergo? You are too bold and forward, it is a thing full of danger.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In the meane time, in the yeare 1453 Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople was taken by the Turks, and two of the diſperſed Grecians being come unto Prague, were courteouſly entertained by <hi>Rokizane,</hi> and ſuffered to celebrate the Maſs, after many diſputations in religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Where when it jointly appeared to them, that the ſincerity of the faith, was overwhelmed with ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition: The good zealous people were more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed in ſpirit, finding what they were to avoid, but having none whom they might follow.</p>
               <p n="6">6. They therefore addreſs themſelves to <hi>Rokizane</hi> again, and beſought him for the Glory of God to take compaſſion on their ſoules, and on the ſeduced people, and not to abandon them in ſo great a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of their ſalvation. But he good man, when (forſooth) hee had not ſo much power to preferre
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:169711:31"/> the Croſs and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="7">7. He obtained for them the Territory of Liticitz one of the hilly countries neer unto Sileſia, whither immediately after thoſe citizens of Prague, Batchelors and Maſters did addreſs themſelves, and from other places not a few as well Plebeians as Nobles, learned and unlearned, their greateſt confluence was to a Towne called Kunwald, devoting themſelves alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to the reading of the Scripture, to prayers, and to workes of piety. This was in the yeare 1459. They choſe them teachers, that is to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. It came to paſse therefore, in the year, 1461. when Father <hi>Gregory</hi> with ſome others did come to <hi>Prague,</hi> to give a viſite to his friends that they were betrayed, and taken in a houſe to which they came to ſupper. At which time this was obſerveable, The Officers ſtood on the threſhold, and ſpeaking to them in the ſcripture phraſe, ſaid, all who will live godly in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> muſt ſuffer perſecution. You therefore that are here, come forth and follow me to Priſon. He was himſelfe an honeſt man, and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:169711:32"/> thought not evill of the Brotherhood, but being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by his ſuperiors, he could not but put his charge in execution.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The King believing the ſlanderous accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of theſe evill men, that the <hi>Brothers</hi> attempted ſome ſedition, as the <hi>Thaborites</hi> before them, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the holy man <hi>Gregory</hi> to be tortured, who being tranſported into an extaſie, did feele no ſence of paine at all, and being believed by the Tormentors to be dead, he was taken downe from the Rack. His Vnckle <hi>Rokizane</hi> comming to him (for he heard he dyed on the Rack) did with many teares lament him, repeating againe, and againe, O my <hi>Gregory,</hi> would I had bin in thy place, but he after ſome houres comming againe to himſelfe, revealed the Viſion which he had ſeene, which was, that he was brought into a moſt pleaſant field, in the middle whereof, there ſtood a tree loaden with fruit, on which divers Birds of ſeverall kinds, ſitting on the branches, did feed, and in the middeſt of them there ſtood a young man, who did ſo rule them with his rod, that not one of them did move or ſtirre out of order. No doubt but by this Revelation, God ſhewed him the Image of that little Church, of which he was as Patriarck.

               <p n="1">1. THoſe brethren had conſtituted amongſt themſelves a certain order, elders by ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages being choſen, who having the Government and direction of things, obedience was promiſed to him. By the counſel of theſe men the chiefeſt of the diſperced through Bohemia and Moravia, being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led together, they had Synods in choſe mountaines, and ordained ſtatutes how they ſhould behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves amongſt themſelves and others, how they ſhould carry themſelves to their friends and Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies as alſo toward the King and all Magiſtrates oftentimes appointing ſolemn dayes of prayer and faſting for themſelves and the diſperſed, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king councell out of the Word of God, concerning thoſe things, which are required to the fuller Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation both of life and Doctrine.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The deepeſt care that did afflict them, was for
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:169711:34"/> Paſtors of ſoules, where they ſhould find new, after thoſe were dead, who then lived with them. To expect that ſome of the Ordination of Rome, ſhould come unto them for the love of the Truth, was an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain hope. And they remembred that <hi>Rokizane</hi> did often proteſt, that all things were to be reſtored from the foundation again. Therefore that there was an Ordination at Rome to be erected, by that authority, which Chriſt gave unto the Church, that whiles they had yet amongſt them ordained men, they might ordaine others, who againe ſhould have power to ordain others to ſucceed them. To this, as their deſires ſo their judgements did incline, but a fear invaded them, whether this Ordination were lawfull or no, becauſe not a Biſhop, but a Presbiter here did create a Presbiter, and how if any controverſie ſhould be, they ſhould defend ſuch an Ordination either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others, or themſelves.</p>
               <p n="3">3. At length after certain yeares moſt ſerious deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berations, the moſt eminent of them in all Bohemia and Moravia, about ſeventy in number, convened at a village not farre from Rich-nove, and many teares and prayers being poured forth to God, that he would vouchſafe to manifeſt if their purpoſe were acceptable to him, and whether this were the time of it, they appointed to try by lots the pleaſure of the Almighty. They therefore by the ſuffrages choſe from the middeſt of them nine men, whom above
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:169711:34"/> others they thought moſt fit for the taking of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, and twelve little Papers cloſely folded up, being put into the hand of a little boy, ſent for on purpoſe, and not knowing what was to be done, he was commanded to diſtribute thoſe twelve lots unto the nine men. Nine of theſe lots were blankes, on the other three were inſcribed the word <hi>I S,</hi> to wit the Will of God, which they deſired might be revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to them. It might therefore come to paſſe that theſe nine men every one might have a blank, which would be a token to them that God was not at that preſent pleaſed at what they went about. But ſo it was, that the three lots were given into the hands of three of them, <hi>Matthew Kunwald,</hi> a moſt Godly man, <hi>Thomas Przelauce,</hi> a learned man, and <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Krzenove,</hi> a man indued with ſingular abilities of underſtanding.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Theſe being with great joy embraced, as men ſent from Heaven unto them: they took new coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels for the Confirmation, and the Ordination of them. And having underſtood, that there were ſome of the Waldenſes in the confines of Moravia, and of Auſtria, that they might provide for the preſent, and for the time to come, for the ſcruples of theirs and other mens conſciences; they ſent unto them <hi>Michael Zamberge</hi> their Paſtor, (who received his Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from a Romane Biſhop) with two others, who ſhould relate what had beene done, and deſire their
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:169711:35"/> judgement in this buſineſs. They find there <hi>Stepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> the Biſhop, who, another Biſhop, and ſome of the Miniſters being ſent for; they declare unto them their Originall from the time of <hi>Constantine,</hi> they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat unto them the Articles of their faith, and what a horrible perſecution they ſuffered for it, both in Italy and in France. Then they hear our men make a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port unto them of their departure from the Pope, and the Calixtines which they approve of and congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late. Moreover, giving power to thoſe three to create Miniſters, they create them Biſhops with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of hands, and return them to thoſe that ſent them.</p>

Therefore ſome able men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſent againe to them they acquaint the Waldenſes withit, who affirm, that the Propoſition for being in an Vnity with them is very gratefull to them. As for

They concluded to have a meeting on a prefixed day about it, in which they would take ſome further order concerning this buſineſſe. But before that time, this being diſcovered, the Papiſts began to rage very violently againſt the Waldenſes, <hi>Stephanus</hi> one of the chiefeſt of them is conſumed with fire at Vienna.

Howſoever they never deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they received the power of ordaining Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and by that, the externall ſucceſſion of them from the Waldenſes, although, and this alſo oftentimes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly as they ſaw occaſion, they wiſely did paſſe by in ſilence.</p>
               <p n="7">7.

               <p n="8">8. Many therefore were apprehended, and for a long time kept in priſon, untill the Death of the King, among whom was one of the chiefeſt of them, by name <hi>Michael Zambergh,</hi> with which unjuſt and cruell proceedings the <hi>Brothers</hi> being moved, did write an Apology to <hi>Rokizane,</hi> and to the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, and afterwards to the King, and at laſt to them All altogether.

THe enemies of the truth could not bee quiet, but a new deſtruction was againe deſigned, to this ſmall flocke of the brothers, for <hi>Iohn Bozake</hi> Biſhop of Warade in Hungary (a Moravian by his birth, a ſubtile man, and burning with an implacable hatred againſt the enemies of the truth) entring into crafty counſell with other Biſhops of Hungaria and Bohemia, the Queen her ſelfe was ſuborned, who great with child, and ſo neere unto her delivery, that it was believed the King would deny her nothing in that eſtate, ſhe ſollicited him for a new edict againſt the Piccardins, and comming to his Chamber, as it was afterwards known by ſome Gentlemen of his Bedchamber, and moſt worthy of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, ſhe deſired that favour that the King would give way to ſo many Petitions, and ſeverely proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:169711:40"/> againſt that ſo much hated fraternity. The King be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing ſad to heare that requeſt, only nodded with his head but gave no anſwer at all.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Preſently upon this the Biſhops in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the King did begin to write the Coppy of the Mandate. The King going into his chamber, did fall on his knees, and with teares beſought God to forgive the guilt of thoſe bloudy Councels, and grant no ſucceſſe unto them. God heard his voyce, and ſhewed ſome Examples of horrid Judgment on the authors of this conſpiracy. The firſt example was the Queene her ſelfe, who (before hand delighting her ſelfe with the immagination of it) did propoſe unto her fancy, what gratefull ſpectacles ſhe ſhould behold at Prague, when being delivered of her Child ſhe ſhould come to that City, and ſee the <hi>Piccardines</hi> ſome burned, ſome beheaded, and ſome ſtifled in the water. But Oh the Judgments of God, for before the time of her delivery, being prevented with the pangs thereof, and not able to bring forth, The Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians, that they might preſerve one, were of opinion that the Child ſhould be cut out of the mothers womb, and the Chyrurgions being come, tooke out the child alive, but (becauſe it was brought into the world before its time) as yet unable to ſee. This was <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donick,</hi> who afterward ſucceded his father in both Kingdomes, but the Mother no longer able to indure the torment did expire, and with her dyed the wicked
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:169711:40"/> contriveances of the enemyes of the Truth for that time. This was at <hi>Buda</hi> in the year 1506. on the beginning of July.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Two yeares after this, the Biſhops obtained what before they attempted, and the King overcome by their importunity, who cryed out that ſharp re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies muſt be uſed to take away ſuch a growing Evill, he commanded that all the <hi>Piccardins</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever without difference either of ſexe, or Age, ſhould be puniſhed with the loſſe of life. This was in the year 1508. on the tenth of Auguſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Ionh,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Warade,</hi> and <hi>Staniſlaus Sturzo,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Olumitz</hi> brought this Edict unto Bohemia, and a full houſe of the ſtates being called, gave it to them. But becauſe many of the chiefe of the Nobility complained, that this Decree was made without the knowledge of the Parliament, they could not conſent that it ſhould carry any force with it. The execution of it therefore went on but ſlowly, and almoſt eighteene moneths were ſpent in diſputations only, and debates about it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. At the laſt by the cunning Artifice, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of <hi>Albert</hi> Chancellor of <hi>Kolowratte</hi> and his Accomplices, this bloudy Edict received force by the aſſent of moſt of the Nobility, in the preſence of the King, at the Parliament held at <hi>Cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>na</hi> in the year 1510. and it was ordered that it ſhould not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ingroſſed in the Records of that Kingdome
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:169711:41"/> but there was a mutuall exhortation, and confederacy that they ſhould proſecute it with an armed power. But God having laide <hi>Albertus</hi> and ſome others on their backs, who were contrivers of this cruelty, he almoſt brought altogether to nothing theſe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors of their cruelty, of which more hereafter.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In theſe troubles the Miniſters of the unity of the brothers were almoſt al turned out of their places, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did they dare to preach or pray but in privat. The moſt chief of them were by name cited into the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery of the Kingdom, but were forbidden by their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons to appear, neither did the publiſhed edict do any more hurt, but only took hold on ſome of the pooreſt of the people, &amp; brought them to be puniſhed.</p>
               <p n="7">7. For the Baron of Schwanberge having appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended ſixe of the hearers of the brothers, at a Village called Augedz, not far from Tuſt, he brought them to Bora where he commanded them to be burned, their names were.</p>

               <p n="1">I. IN this place it is conceived requiſite to give an account of ſome examples of Gods judgement, ſhewed at this time and a little before upon the bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy endeavours of ſome cruell enemies, <hi>Albert Kolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrat</hi> Chancellor of the Kingdom returned from the Parliament above mentioned, and in his way gave a viſite to the Baron of Coldice, and with great pleaſure reported to him what there they had al agreed upon, Coldice asked his ſervant <hi>Simon,</hi> that ſtood by him, a man addicted to the diſcipline of the brothers, how he liked it.

                  </gap> they were who durſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe all the States of the Kingdome, whoſoever they were he ſaid they were Traitours to the Kingdome, wretched Villaines, and to bee involved in the ſame puniſhment with the Piccardines. The ſervant lifting up his hand, in heaven (he ſaid) there is one, who if hee were not preſent at your counſells, you have taken counſell in vain. The Chancellour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, knave thou ſhalt find that, as well as the reſt; and full of fury he roſe up, making haſt to his owne habitation at Krupha. But in that very moment, a Carbuncle grew upon his foot, which turned into that diſeaſe called <hi>Ignis ſacer,</hi> which being to be extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by no Art of the Phyſitians, did extinguiſh the impious man; from whence it came to paſſe, that the Bellowes of diviſion being taken away, the others did break more gently.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But the great Artiſt of Warade haſtning from Bohemia into Moravia, and willing to a light from his Chariot not far from Olumitz to make water, his breeches (according to the faſhion of that time) being not on, hee ſo ſtrooke his Member on a ſharp naile that was by the boot of his Chariot, that in his haſty deſcent, hee drew out his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tralls with him, ſome part of them ſticking upon
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:169711:42"/> the point of the nail, and not long after hee gave up the Ghoſt.</p>

               <p>HE was a Citizen of Cuttenburgh, but by reaſon hee had changed his Religion, he came to Lito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſa to which place his wife being unwilling to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, when on a certain time he came back to ſee her, ſhee betrayed him. Therefore being taken, hee ſo long was vexed with the Calixtine Prieſts, that he promiſed to live againe with his wife, and to obey the Prieſts. This he did outwardly; but his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience inwardly did check him for it: therefore on a ſolemn day, when the Parſon, his ſermon being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, had brought forth the Hoſte, and placed it on the Altar, and the people falling down did worſhip it, <hi>Andrew</hi> being not able to containe the fire bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

Oh worſhip the living God in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, bleſſed for evermore.</hi> The Parſon forbad the people to return an anſwer to him, and willed them to lay hold on that moſt wicked knave the Piccardine.

               <p n="2">2. The next day he was brought into the Court, the Senate and the Parſon being preſent, and being demanded whether he would ſpeak thoſe words again which he ſpake yeſterday, he affirmed that he would. Being asked again, By what Inſtinct he durſt doe it. He anſwered, by what Inſtinct did Abraham depart from the Idolaters, and worſhip the euerliving God. They preſſing on him to tell them preciſely, by whoſe perſwaſion hee durſt commit ſo hainous a fact? hee anſwered, By whoſe perſwaſion did <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> oppoſe himſelfe againſt the worſhipping of Idolls.</p>

               <p n="1">I. IN all theſe times, the condition of the church of the Brothers was moſt heavy, but neither were the Calixtines free from affliction, eſpecially the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer ſort of them, being thoſe who were moſt zealous againſt the Papiſts; for in the year 1408. Mr. <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael Polach,</hi> paſtor of St. <hi>Ades</hi> in old Prague, a man of unblemiſhed life, and an excellent prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, with three other Parſons, Mr. <hi>Wenceſlaus Slane, Iohn Miezta,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wenceſlaus Piſcene,</hi> were apprehended by the command of King <hi>Wladiſlaus,</hi> becauſe they affirmed the Pope to be Antichriſt. They were carried into the Caſtle of Calreiſteine where the firſt of them periſhed by hunger, and the naſtineſſe of the priſon; the other with much adoe were diſmiſſed by the order of the States. At which time, many other who were more reformed in their judgements, were either driven from Prague, as Mr. <hi>Mathias Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheeke</hi> profeſsor of the Univerſity, or willingly depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as <hi>Lucas Pragene,</hi> Batchelour of Art, an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent man (who afterwards, as before I have recited, was a Biſhop amongſt the Brothers) there alſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooke the Vniverſity of their own accord, Mr. <hi>Iohn
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:169711:45"/> Snow</hi> a Phyſitian, and others.</p>
               <p n="2">2. On the ſame year, the King forbad the ſinging of the ballads made againſt the abominations of the Church of Rome, and becauſe they would not refrain, many of the beſt rank of the Citizens were apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and a long time detained in priſon. One or two of them were ſtead alive, as <hi>Matthew Serling, Martin</hi> of the golden wheele, <hi>Scheynohin,</hi> who was alſo a Citizen of Prague, through the violence of the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment did break aſunder.</p>
               <p n="3">3. On this the Monks having taken new courage, began more freely to inveigh againſt thoſe that tooke the Sacrament in both kinds, and condemned the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites, the people variouſly, but vainly, murmuring at it. The Senators alſo of Prague, and many Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts and Germanes, abuſing the clemency of the King, did grow ſo intollerably bold, that ſome noble men, who were adverſaries to the Religion, conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together, and on the 24 of December at night, intended to put to death the chiefeſt of the Citizens who received the Sacrament under both kinds. But they were deceived of their expectation and hope, God ſo ordaining it that the evill returned vpon the heads of the contrivers of it. For their treachery being betrayed, their was a mighty Tumult in which the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:169711:45"/> at which though <hi>Wladiſlaus</hi> was much afflicted, yet inquiry being made, and it being found that the Papiſts gave the cauſe thereof, he pardoned the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of Prague. And in the year 1485, he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed by Parliament an agreement betwixt the communicants under one and both kinds, howſoever the hatred betwixt them and the reproachfull words did ſtill continue.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In the yeare 1491, on the 28 of <hi>Ianuary</hi> at <hi>Laeta Curia</hi> a chiefe Temple of the Huſſites. The Euchariſt being adminiſtred under both kinds, a Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man comming behind a Gentlewoman, as ſhe was drinking of the cup, hee ſtrooke her head ſo violently, that her mouth being cleaved, bloud iſſued forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly, for which notorious offence hee was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, and thrown into priſon, but not long after diſmiſſed.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But in the Vacation of the Arch-Biſhopprick, the Calixtine Prieſts could not receive their Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions but in Italy, where moſt of them were bound to renounce the articles under both kinds, and to performe obedience unto the ſea of Rome, which was very grievous to the Bohemians, therefore in the yeare 1482. there <hi>Sanctuarenſis</hi> a Biſhop came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Bohemia from Italy, for the love as hee ſaid of the pure Religion, whom when <hi>Auguſtinus Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> and others, had received with much joy and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, he died i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="6">6. But ſome of the ſchollers amongſt whom was <hi>Iohn Bezhink</hi> ſo truly hated the Pope, that having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived letters of commendation from the Univerſity, they went as farre as <hi>Armenia</hi> to be ordained Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters. And becauſe that there the fame had arrived of the Hereſie of the Bohemians, they were the more ſtrictly examined: and it being found that they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed with them in the chiefeſt Articles of Religion, and alſo in the language, they were ordained Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, in the yeare 1499.

As alwayes heretofore ſo now alſo wee hold nothing more deare or ancient, than that we may be found conſtant in the body of the Church by the unity of faith, and obedience to the Apoſtolicall ſeat, neither can your reverence expect any thing more welcome than what it ſhall receive from our Legates, whom ſhortly we wil ſend unto you.

               <p n="1">I. THerefore that <hi>Zahere</hi> and <hi>Paſſoke</hi> might the better pleaſe both the King and Pope, they enforced all the Paſtors and citizens to ſubſcribe to their new Articles, and thoſe who refuſed were to bee baniſhed the city. In the firſt place ſixe Paſtors were proſcribed, <hi>Wenceſlaus Poczatek,</hi> Paſtor of St. <hi>Gallus, George Smahal,</hi> Paſtor of St. <hi>Henry, Matin Betlem, Paul de St, Michaell, Martin de Opatowitz,</hi> and <hi>John Maruſſa,</hi> after threeſcore and five of their chiefeſt citizens were proſcribed, amongſt whom was <hi>Burian de Cornitz</hi> Doctour of law and Chancellour of Prague, <hi>John Hlawſa,</hi> who was Exconſull and others. Likewiſe a coulour was ſought for the greater cruelty, a malicious inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being ſpread abroad concerning a certaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy of the Goſpellers againſt the Calixtines, that they might extort the confeſſion hereof, they did bring three citizens <hi>John Bonuſſa, Matthew Hrze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benarz</hi> and <hi>Iohn Sliwkam</hi> to the rack, who rather choſe to ſuffer innocently; than to bear falſe witneſſe, a thing they utterly deteſted in their conſcience.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the meane time while theſe firebrands of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:169711:49"/> confirmed an agreement, betweene thoſe of Prague, that no man ſhould be queſtioned, <hi>concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his faith (to wit the Piccardine &amp; Lutheran)</hi> but that al ſhould be reſtored to their former freedom &amp; enjoy the liberty of the city. It was requeſted that an Embaſſador ſhould bee diſpatched to <hi>Buda</hi> unto the K. for the confirmation of this ordinance. It was now lawfull for any to do what they pleaſed to thoſe of a good and right opinion. If one of them were found that was unwilling to pay what hee ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they would lay to his charge that he was a Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardine; ſome were not ſimply baniſhed, but ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully brought forth, as <hi>Ludovicus Pictor,</hi> becauſe at the end of his ſermon hee had admoniſhed the Monk of St. <hi>Barbara</hi> prating fooliſhly. <hi>That it was far better that the people ſhould be inſtructed out of the Goſpell, than be detained with ſuch fables.</hi> By the clamors of the Monke hee was laid hold on by the common people that were called together, and hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to priſon, and afterwards by a Serjeant was led out of the City.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A certain Cutler becauſe they had found about him a booke concerning the Sacraments, penned by a man of a ſincere opinion, was whipped openly in the market place and baniſhed.

               <p n="4">4. In the meane time the Aſſemblies of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome being held, and thoſe wicked pragmatical men urging it, it was agreed upon, that the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants under one and both kinds, by the violence of thoſe that were joyned together ſhould bee one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but the commands of <hi>Wladiſlaus</hi> ſhould bee put in execution againſt the Piccardins.

               <p n="5">5.

               <p n="3">3. Among others who if need were did inſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this good Prince peaceable principles, was that diſcreet man <hi>John Cratis</hi> a phyſitian: him he made choiſe of for his chief Doctor, and eſteemed of him as his ſpeciall friend and acquaintance. This man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone with <hi>Caeſar</hi> going into the field for the recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of himſelf, was taken up into his Chariot, and recounting unto <hi>Caeſar</hi> with much grief, the many differences in Chriſtianity, demanded of <hi>Crato</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all ſects that of late ſprung up in the Church, which he thought came neereſt the Apoſtolicall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, anſwered. I know not whether I may ſay to the brethren which are called Piccardines. <hi>Caeſar</hi> replied, I am of that opinion. <hi>Crato</hi> tooke that boldneſſe to perſwade the brethren, whom he knew had ſet forth a new edition of a Germane Hymne, that they ſhould dedicate it unto the Emperour;
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:169711:58"/> which was done in the year 1566, where the Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie epiſtles mentioned, that al their hope was in him, both for the preſervation of them and their goods, &amp; that his Majeſty would promote the univerſal Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Church: and encouraged him by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>David, Jehoſaphat, Joſiah, Conſtantine</hi> &amp; <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> and at length did not doubt, but that he would imploy that talent which God had given him, for the advancing of ſo good a cauſe, even as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face ſhewes, which all the bookes of thoſe Songs do prefer. And it is probable that the Prince did not want a will, if in regard of the policy of thoſe men who had the Scepters of Kings in their poſſeſsions, and had bound up their hands, it might have been lawfull.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In the third yeare of his reigne, 1565. the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the truth forged a new proceſſe againſt the Brethren, abuſing the authority of <hi>Ioachim de No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va Domo</hi> Chancellour of Bohemia; who going to Vienna, wrought ſo by continuall diligence with <hi>Caeſar,</hi> that hee ſhould urge <hi>Wladiſlaus</hi> to ſubſcribe (though unwillingly) the old Mandate, with a new one againſt the Piccardines. But the goodneſſe of God had a watchfull eye ouer his, and would not permit ſo good and innocent a Prince to have a hand in bloud, or be burthened with the cries of the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. For when the Chancellour returned ſtrengthned with the Princes Letters patents, and ſcarce entring the ports of Vienna, comming over the bridge Danu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bium,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:169711:59"/> it ſo came to paſſe, that the yoake of the oxe being looſened, the bridge cleaved aſunder, and hee with his train was drowned in the water, ſix Knights only ſwimming out, ſaved their lives, and one young Nobleman, who at length in his old age died, but eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped alive to be a witnes of the daily revenging hand of God, but he avouched the Religion of the Brethren, for which he had had experience that God was watchfull. This man ſaw his Lord ſwimming above the waters of Danubium, and held him by his golden Chaine, untill fiſhermen, who were then comming toward him in a ſmall ſhip, came to help him. So the Baron was taken up, but dead: but the cheſt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he had locked his deadly inſtruments, ſunke into the Sea, that it was never ſeen any more, neither was there any one that would looke after it. <hi>Thuanus,</hi> maketh mention, of this Story in his 36 booke, and reports this accident to have happened on the fourth of the Ides of December.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Ten yeares after, in the yeare 1575. <hi>Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianus</hi> called a Parliament at Prague, and permitted all the Orders in the Kingdome under both kinds to be reconciled, by the common ſigne of the confesſion of one faith, the Jeſuites and falſe Huſsits endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with might and main to hinder it. Among other things when they had uſed their beſt endeavours by petitions and proteſtations, alleadging that the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in both kinds doe not agree in their faith, but
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:169711:59"/> that they have among them Piccardines, Calviniſts, Lutherans, &amp;c. The Orders that they might evidence their conſent, conſulted together about the regiſtring of a common confeſsion: for which purpoſe they made choiſe of certaine Divines, who with ſome of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, Noblemen and Citizens, were overſeers. The chiefe men of Prague brought forth the books of <hi>Hus,</hi> and the Synodicall and Parliamentary decrees of the ancient Bohemians concerning Religion. The greater part of the Order who ſtood for the <hi>Auguſtine</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion, produced this their confeſsion, as the Brethren brought forth theirs. Then they compared the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles together, and the ſenſe and manner of ſetting down of each part, and expreſſed them in ſuch forms that each part might ſubſcribe unto them, not inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to trouble themſelves too much with particular and ſubtile Scholaſticall diſputations; which Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian moderation and wiſdome, did not only then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit them, but alſo pleaſed many eminent men, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well in Germany as elſewhere: for <hi>Caeſar</hi> confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med their confeſsion of faith, and did receive ſuch as did ſubſcribe, into his Kingly protection: but hee gave them not power according to their deſires, for the appointing of a Conſiſtory, or Academy at that time, yet promiſing very faithfully, that neither hee nor his ſonne, (whom they had deſigned his ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor) would bee wanting in giving full ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to their deſires (you muſt obſerve that this confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

The Wittenburghian Divines approved of it, and among others uſed theſe expreſsions in their anſwer to the Baron, although this Confeſsion be briefe, and we eaſily obſerve that in the compoſing them the chiefeſt care was, that they might be conciſely, elegantly, and properly expreſsed; for the avoiding of tediouſneſse, and contentions about ſcrupulous queſtions, which peradventure ſome wrangling Sophiſters in our Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many would have taxed, if it had beene ſet forth in their owne native language: We therefore cannot but approve of your Chriſtian prudence and tempe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rance. Therefore we willingly adviſe you publickly, that however opinions may ariſe from other places, that you adhere to this, and ſuffer not your ſelfe to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:169711:60"/> bee led away, from this holy and pure truth. For this is certaine that the church is very well provided for, and is then chiefly built up, and kept in unity, and unanimity, when the pure doctrin of the Goſpell without far-fetched ſubtilities, and emergent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions is propounded to Chriſtian people, in ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of truth, as it is in Pſalm the 25. <hi>Let inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity and uprightneſſe preſerve me.</hi> Dated at Wittenbergh 3.

               <p n="1">I. I Muſt begin higher, that the bottom of our calamity may be more apparent. The occaſion of the grant of this ample Religious Liberty, by <hi>Rodol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phus</hi> to the Bohemians and Sileſians, was, becauſe the Hungarians with Auſtrians and Moravians forſaking <hi>Rodolphus,</hi> for ſome civile cauſes, had created his brother <hi>Matthew</hi> Archduke, King, Duke and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis, and with a great army in the year, 1608. entring into Bohemia, even unto Prague, did not only demand the Crowne of Hungarie, which was there kept, but courted the Bohemians to a revolting, but they with the Sileſians, were faithfull to him, and <hi>Mathew</hi> with the Crowne of Hungarie, and hope for ſucceſſion in the Kingdome of Bohemia after the death of <hi>Rodolphus,</hi> being ſent away, they asked
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:169711:63"/> and obtained, for that they had ſworne fealty to <hi>Rodolphus,</hi> the former promiſed favour of Religious liberty, and the power of the Conſiſtorie and Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the meane time, for this affront put upon him by his Brother, he was very much vexed, and the more, becauſe foreſeeing the Spaniſh plots began to boad no good luck to his Bohemians, and all Germanie, he began to enter into new conſultation with himſelfe, and he was troubled in mind not konw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whom he might truſt with his ſecrets; at the length he made choiſe of two Barons, whom he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped would be faithfull unto him, the one from Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria, Mr. <hi>Kahu,</hi> the other from Moravia, Mr. <hi>Schamid,</hi> both which were of Stiriacus, but both by <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Archduke, in the year 1600. refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Stiria, with many other baniſhed there coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, theſe he calls to Prague to him in the year 1610. and opens his caſe to them: he is ſorrie that <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tthias</hi> muſt ſucceed him, who becauſe he was but a young man, and was altogether at the beck of the Clergie, very much feared that he would come, and that they would recommend <hi>Ferdinand</hi> to be adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and by that meanes get the Scepter. He reſolves therefore upon <hi>Leopaldus</hi> of his owne family, that he ſhall be the ſucceſſor of his Kingdome, whom he knew, though now a Biſhop, and brother in law to <hi>Ferdinrnd</hi> was of a more milde temper, and would
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:169711:63"/> hearken to good Counſell. And that he might not be ſeduced, he would undertake ſome memorable thing, to wit, that he would erect an <hi>Order of Peace</hi> for the liberty of Conſciences, and that he ſhould be blameleſſe, that called upon Chriſt any way; and to the fellowſhip of this order, he would invite all Kings and Princes that were promoters of the Goſpell, and alſo Catholicks, if they would come. When he had got a Catalogue of their names, he ſigned it, and ſhewed it to them, the number being about fifty; and reading the forme of the Covenant, or ſocietie of that Order made by himſelfe, and bringing forth two gold chaines, giving to each of them one, with the enſigne of Peace made by his owne hands, of which ſort he ſaid he would make more according to the number of the ſocietie of that Order.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He demandeth of them, even with aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hearkning unto him, whether they were ready to promote ſo holy and pious reſolution. They know not, they ſay what can bee hoped for in ſo great a matter in regard of his poverty, but hee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, I intended to make uſe of your two beſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors on an Embaſſy. Yours <hi>Rakin</hi> to the Prince of Germany, yours <hi>Schmedi</hi> to the chiefe of Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia and Moravia, but in the firſt place I muſt provide for the ſafeguard of my ſelfe and my Kingdome, yee ſhall therefore firſt go unto <hi>Leopaldus</hi> and give this advice unto him, and by letters written with my own
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:169711:64"/> hand, I will give teſtimony of your fidelity, and if hee ſhall conſent which I know he will, it ſhall be your care that an army be raiſed, and then to return to me, being amazed at theſe things, <hi>Caeſar</hi> gave them three dayes to conſider of it.

                  </gap>e them but with ill ſucceſſe. For although in the year 1611 the army of the Paſſavians had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred by force as far as Prague, yet <hi>Matthias</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with his army gave them a repulſe, and was made King of Bohemia, and <hi>Rodolphus</hi> with grief died.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I cannot paſſe this over with ſilence, when the Baron <hi>Schmidius,</hi> returning from Paſſavia, was ſent on an Embaſſy to the chief of Bohemia and Moravia, intimating the intention of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> all things happen contrary to their expectation, for they gave no credite to them, all of them interpreting, that they came with colourab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e pretences, and that ſome crafty plot lay hid, or elſe fearing a warre betweene thoſe two Kings. <hi>Schmidius</hi> having declared this to the Emperour being very angry, he ſuddenly aroſe from his ſeat, and haſtned to the window, and opening it violently, looking toward the City, ſaid, Prague, ungratefull Prague, <hi>thou haſt beene made glorious by mee, doeſt thou now reject me your benefactour, the vengeance of God follow thee, and may a curſe light upon thee, Prague, and all Bohemia.</hi> I heard
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:169711:64"/> all this from the mouth of the Baron <hi>Schmidius</hi> in his Caſtle at Kunſtat, where the good old man, being threeſcore and ten yeares old, ſhewed me the chaine, and enſigne dedicated to the Order of Peace, &amp; weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſaid, <hi>this, that religious a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="5">5. That purpoſe concerning the founding the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Peace, without all doubt was ſo pleaſing, that it is a wonder that it went not forward. Some peradventure may ſuppoſe, that they much erred from Politique counſels, that this buſineſſe was not otherwiſe, and by others begun, but if we looke high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, they are the juſt judgments of God, bringing this whole nation and all Germanie to puniſhment, and ſuffering our enemies to fill up the meaſure of their fathers.

               <p n="6">6.

               <p n="1">I. IN the year 1617, <hi>Matthias</hi> came into the Kingdome unhoped for, accompanied with his Coſsen Germane <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and the decree be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſent out to the Orders, that the Aſſemblies ſpeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily ſhould come together he went to Dreſda Elector of Saxonie, deſiring to get <hi>Ferdinand</hi> into his favour, and returning he goeth to the Aſſembly, ſome few of the Order in hope, not by any deſire of their owne, appearing. For it was now harveſt time, neither did any one then take pleaſure in being taken from his houſhold affaires.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There <hi>Caeſar</hi> complained that he had no iſſue, and therefore told them that he would adopt <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> his ſonne, he commendeth his virtues, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth that he may be received and crowned; the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders anſwered, that a matter of that conſequence in the abſence of the vnited Provinces, could not be done. <hi>Caeſar</hi> vrgeth; that Bohemia is the chiefe ſeat,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:169711:65"/> and whatſoever they ſhould doe, would be confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the reſt, that he grew faint, and therefore the buſineſſe could not be deferred untill another time. It came to that paſs that the Orders did proteſt that, <hi>that Terme of receiving him King was new,</hi> he ought firſt to be choſen before he were received. But all theſe things by divers devices, and private affections of ſome men, and the affrightings of others were deluded and daſhed. Whence it came to paſſe, that ſome perceiving that there was no place for a free voyce, departed. But they which ſtayed and were preſent at the Coronation, cauſed this, that before he were crowned, he ſhould give ſomething in writing to the Orders wherewith he ſhould bind himſelfe, <q>that <hi>Mathew</hi> being alive he ſhould meddle with none of the affarres of Bohemia, much leſſe Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</q> He is therefore crowned, and preſently went into Moravia, and then into Sileſia and Luſitania, and there requeſted that he might be received.</p>
               <p n="3">3 And after this time the enemies being made more confident, boaſt themſelves outragiouſly, and began to wiſh ill luck to the Evangeliſts, as alſo to threaten them openly. And <hi>Ferdinand</hi> going into Moravia, to receive homage, the Jeſuites erect at Olumatium a Triumphall Arche, and paint upon it among the Armes of Auſtria, with the Lion of Bohemia tied to it with a chaine, and the Eagle of Moravia, with a ſleeping hare lying with open eyes, and

               <p n="4">4. And it appeared moſt ſufficiently that <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> ſware to the Orders with his mouth, in his heart to the Pope; truly from that time ſomething hath bin attempted, whereby it might not be well with the Goſpelers, either by paſſing from them their right by coſening, or by overcoming their patience, that by open injuries they might give them occaſion to oppoſe them. Preſently after <hi>Ferdinand</hi> was gone, they went about, not only the Biſhop and the Clergie, but the Laity, with thoſe that did belong to the Pope. <hi>Slawata, Smeczanski</hi> and others (in Moravia, <hi>Olomucenſis</hi> the Biſhop; and alſo the chiefe Duke <hi>Ladiſlaus de Lobkowitz,</hi> the Lord of <hi>Holdſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

From the Chaires of the Jeſuites, not only the Goſpellers, but alſo that bountifull <hi>Rodolphus</hi> now dead, and the Liberty of Religion granted to the Kingdome by him, ſhamefully defamed and taunted at; and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that their Liberty ſhould not laſt long.</p>
               <p n="5">5 They did likewiſe inhibite by a ſpeciall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that they ſhould print nothing unleſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed and approved of by the Chancelour of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, divulging in the meane while their owne ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous Pamphlets, and dangerous writings againſt the Goſpellers. Alſo inſtruction was given from the ſame Chancery of the Citizens of Prague, to the Captaines and Judges, of <hi>Caeſar</hi> (who were Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings) to require earneſtly of the pariſhoners the foundations of the Churches from the Originall. And that they no way give nor conſent to any meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings unleſſe they themſelves were preſent, and to joyne with the chiefe overſeeres and Parſon, of the ſaid Pariſh vnder one kind, (which after was done in ſome Churches) and at length to deny unto the defendors and thoſe of the Conſiſtorie, any executing proceſs of Law.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And they dealt under hand with the Paſtors, whom they did believe, they might reduce to <hi>Pſudo-Huſſitiſme,</hi> that they ſhould require, by preſenting to the King an humble declaration, that the new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory

When he perceived himſelfe to be very ſick, ſo that he was ready to die, and calling to mind his former act &amp; deteſting his perfidiouſnes, and dehorting his confederates from that fact, their Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems are brought to nothing.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Since this exploit of theirs tooke no effect, they went another way to work. The Church of Bethleem which from its firſt foundation was dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Univerſity, was lately by the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Conſiſtory, diſpoſed of to the uſe of the brethren in the year 1609 after the death of the Senior of theſe <hi>Matthew Cirus</hi> in the year 1607. the Papiſts threaten to ſue them at the law &amp; endeavor to deprive them of the Church: but the Profeſſor of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity making uſe of their own right they bring in <hi>John Cyrillus</hi> for Senior according to their ſolemn form. theſe and the like they made triall of in other places, but ſtill without ſucceſſe.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The Burgrave <hi>Carelſteinenſis</hi> (that is to ſay) the ſafeguard of the Crown and priviledges of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome) is alſo taken away by the Count <hi>Turnenſis,</hi> a Preſident never before heard of, and againſt all

The enemies look't upon it as a miracle that none of thoſe that were throwne downe loſt their lives; but truly it was not ſo ſtrange, that men falling on the ſoft ground ſtrewed with papers (under the Chancery window) ſhould remain without any hurt. It was rather a ſigne that God would have them preſerved to be the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemians ſcourges.</p>

Then they could not well put a difference betweene the Lutheranes and Calviniſts, as they did between the Anabaptiſts and Proteſtants, and laſtly it was not now a time to provoke the Princes of the reformed Religion.

By which means as the enemies themſelves
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:169711:73"/> boaſted, were taken from the Proteſtants ſome milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Gold, and it is not unlikely. For almoſt all the treaſures of all men, and the jewels and beſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veables, were brought hither in the time of the War as to the centure of ſecurity, no man conſidering that God had provided a rod for their backs. But all this rich prey within the Walls of Prague fel to the ſhares of Commanders: but the neighboring places were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the fury of the reſt, where the Germans, Italian, Spaniſh, French, Polonian, and Croation ſouldiers (for with the ſcumme of ſo many Nations fighting for Antichriſt in <hi>Caeſars</hi> name were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed) robbed, and utterly ſpoiled Villages, Towns, Pariſhes, and Churches, burning and killing without any reſtraint.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Garriſon Souldiers that were afterwards diſperſed into ſeverall Lordſhips &amp; Cities, would not onely have free quarter, but would extort mony from their Landlords every day.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Preſently Commiſſioners were ſent to promiſe ſecurity to thoſe Cities and Noblemen, that were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into <hi>Caeſars</hi> protection. But with this conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that every Baron, Knight, and Corporation, and alſo the Miniſters, ſhould bring in a good ſumme of mony for the payment of the Souldiers ſtipends, which (as they often ſaid) they would not receive as a free gift, but only borrow it. <hi>Caeſars</hi> protection was promiſed to thoſe that were liberall, and the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:169711:74"/> reſt were threatned to be given up to the ſouldiers fury to bee plundered. Neither were they content with that which every one did freely offer according to his eſtate, but ſet a price as it were according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of buyers, writing downe in particular Tables made to that purpoſe, what ſummes were to bee paid within the compaſſe of ſome dayes: <hi>viz.</hi> a hundred, a thouſand, two, three, ſix thouſand Florence. And becauſe they promiſed that upon the payment of the mony the Souldiers ſhould bee removed, therefore e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one brought in his part more willingly, and ſome readily bringing in their plate and Jewells.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A little while after other Commiſſioners ſent to require certain Cities of the Nobility to maintain the ſtanding forces of the Kingdome (for the greateſt part of the Army was drawn into Moravia and Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria) and to contribute Corn, wherein alſo publick Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries might be erected.

                  <hi>CHAP. L.</hi> The Proceeding againſt the Ministers of the Word, and chiefly the ſeverall cruelties acted against them by the overmuch liberty of the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</head>
               <p>THe Preamble of this future Tyranny was the barbarous licence of the Kings Souldiers againſt the Miniſters of the Word even before the Victory a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe who fell into their hands, amongſt theſe who had experience of this, I will make mention of <hi>Wenceſlaus Woticius</hi> of Byſtrick (under <hi>Hoſtinus</hi> a Paſtor in Moravia) whom the Polonian Souldiers being led this way into Auſtria, without either regard

               <p n="2">2. In like manner when Prague was taken, there in that Country certain Paſtors had experience of the fury of Antichriſt, afterwards in other places. For power being granted to the ſouldiers to plunder, they ſuppoſed that they might do what they pleaſed to thoſe Miniſters which were termed Hereticks. We will put you in mind of ſome.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Paulus Mollerus</hi> Paſtor of the Towne of Zrutche as he was preaching to his Pariſhioners, the Caeſarian ſouldiers broke in, wounded him with a bullet, and he gave up the Ghoſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The L. <hi>Smilo</hi> of Lukawetz, being Patron of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Mareſch</hi> who was Paſtor in the Village Kreſſin, was conveyed by his Lord and Patron for fear of the guard that paſſed that way, into a more ſafe place of re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tire, the guard as ſoon as they broke in, did examin the School-maſter <hi>Frederick Damhoſky,</hi> whom they apprehended, and bound with cords, where the Lord and the Paſtor were, or where they did hide their treaſures. He profeſſeth that he neither knew the one nor the othe, they notwithſtanding urge him,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:169711:78"/> and firſt they beat him with their fiſts, and cudgel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him, at the length having him naked, ſo cruelly they ſinged him, that not being able to indure the pain, he promiſed to ſhew them where the treaſure was. He ſhewes unto them a ditch full of ſtones, which they, out of the great deſire they had of the gold, did empty, but finding nothing there, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim on him, and beat him afreſh. He acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth that he knew of no treaſure, but through ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of paine had ſaid ſo much, when they had ſoundly cudgelled him, they with clots afterward beat him into the ditch, and ſo buried him under that heap of ſtones. The third day after, theſe bloud-ſuckers light upon the Paſtor in the Village of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powitzh, and after they had miſerably tortured him left him half dead, but he recovered, and lived five dayes after, but never ſaw his two daughters, whom thoſe lewd fellowes had led away with them, and ſhamefully abuſed.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Wenceſlaus Iakeſſius</hi> was Miniſter of Kauni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium, four miles diſtant from Prague, whom they carried to Koſtelicium beyond <hi>Albis,</hi> and for the ſpace of one moneth and ſomewhat more, they many wayes perplexed him with new invented mockeries: They ſpit in his face, buffeted him with their fiſts, and not onely ſo, but left him to the mercy of every vild raſcall to be beaten: They ſo ſtrained his head with a knotty cord twined about his head with a ſtick,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:169711:78"/> that his very eyes ſwelled in his head. Alſo they let looſe a wild horſe upon him in the middeſt of a Court-yard, which no ſooner came neare him, but he leaped quite over him and did him no harme; at length he redeemed himſelf with much ado, by paying five hundred Florences for his ranſome. They took alſo with him <hi>Paulus Welwarius</hi> Paſtor of <hi>Czela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kowcenſe,</hi> whom, becauſe hee had a farre greater e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, they handled more ſharply, and ſometime co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered him over with hot burning Coles, and ſomtime with ice, until he was conſtrained to pay one thouſand five hundred Florences, but after ſome few days by reaſon of thoſe extreame paines hee yielded up the Ghoſt.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Andreas Stembergius Budinus</hi> being brought by fifteene horſemen from his Pariſh to Koſtelici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, was miſerably tortured by twiſting a cord about his head, and not onely ſo, but they tied his hands behind him, &amp; bound his feet with a ſmal cord, and ſo flang him on his back, with an intent the next morning to have tortured him with fire, but in the night time moſt miraculouſly he was ſet at liberty, for being ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt &amp; at his prayers among other portions of the Pſal. reciting theſe words. <hi>In thee O Lord is my truſt,</hi> he perceived his feet &amp; his hands to be looſened; he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore raiſeth himſelf up and goeth unto the gate, and doth paſſe by the watch-men, being three in number; the one ſtood at the paſſage with his hand upon his
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:169711:79"/> ſword (yet all of them as it were drowzy, whether it were that they had ſlept ſoundly, or by reaſon of a great wind which ſuddenly did ariſe, they did not perceive the noiſe. At length he came to the gate of the Town, and is known by the Muſqueteer that ſtood Centinell. And he, becauſe hee was a Bohemian and being overcome with his intreaties, tooke compaſſion on him, and not onely let him paſſe, but led him over the bridge unto the other Rivers bank.</p>

For caſting the miſerable man flatte on his backe, they filled his mouth with Gunpowder, ſet fire to it, and tore all his jawes and there devilliſh diſpoſitions taking pleaſure in ſo barberous ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, miſerably killed him.</p>
               <p n="12">12. <hi>Adam Piſecius</hi> was Paſtor of Byreſchrum in Moravia in the Dominion of <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Zerotina,</hi> who becauſe his Patron had kept faith with <hi>Caeſar,</hi> feared no hurt, and entertaining curteouſly both in language and geſture, the Souldiers that came unto him, being wanting in nothing that might ſpeake their welcome, but they aſſoone as they began to have knowledge of the Miniſter, were mad, and firſt of all beat him ſhrewdly, and then kill him as he was flying to the porch of the Temple, and ſtript him of his clothes, and robd the houſe. And when ſome godly people intending to bury him, had caſt a cloake over him, the Souldiers running thither not onely do take it away, but tore it in a great rage, neither content with this, they burnt his library which he had diſpoſed of in three places; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no man durſt come ſo long as this company of vile and naughty men remained there, this Martyr lay ſeven weekes unburied, and then was buried by ſome certaine Scholars.</p>

This we are certain of, that it is no new device, for the enemies of the Church, to lay ſuch notable aſperſions upon the Godly, that they might put a fairer gloſſe upon their tyranny. We will hereafter acquaint you how the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of this Martyr (a man of eighty yeares of age) laid his life downe for Religion in the ſame yeare at Proſtanna in Moravia.</p>

               <p n="2">2. But <hi>John Jacob</hi> the greater an Italian, and a man that was very rich, and <hi>Iohn Erneſtas Plateſius,</hi> a Canon of Colmucenſis, came unto that illuſtrious Baron, <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Zerotina,</hi> a man for his wiſedome, and other Heroieall Virtues, famous through all Europe. And under <hi>Matthias</hi> for the ſpace of eight yeares <hi>pro-Mazchio,</hi> and being in great favour with the houſe of Auſtria for his fidelity to them, onely envied for his conſtancie in Religion, for even at that time he maintained 24 of the fraternity in his juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, for which they required that he ſhould give ſatisfaction to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> neither could <hi>Caeſar</hi> looſe any priviledge thereby: They ſay they have an expreſs command from Ditrichſteinus the Cardinall, the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of Moravia, he tells them againe, that in matters of Religion he ought not to be ſubject to
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:169711:91"/> the Cardinall, and therefore from the Cardinall he appeales to <hi>Caeſar.</hi>

Very willingly they agree to this, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doe grant him but fourteene dayes, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſt and the Baron in regard of the ill diſpoſition of his body, could not goe unto <hi>Caeſar,</hi> the next day after the Epiphanie they returne, and preſs hard for the execution of <hi>Caeſars</hi> will, yet it was left to the Barons choiſe, whether he would promiſe to ſend the Miniſters away, or whether he would leave this thing for them to doe. The Baron ſayd, that neither of theſe was convenient, that either he ſhould baniſh thoſe whom he knew to bee the ſervants of Chriſt, or that the Commiſſioners ſhould preſcribe it to him; but that he would appeal to <hi>Caeſar.</hi> They proteſted that they ought to put in execution the commands of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and therefore immediately goe into the town, and make ready the citation, and having called the the Burrouhg Maſter of the Towne, require him to provide them a meſsenger, and preſently, even that night, (that they may declare themſelves to be of the number of thoſe whom the Scripture ſayth, <q>cannot take their reſt unleſs they may doe ſome miſchiefe, or thoſe whoſe ſleep departeth from them except they may deſtroy, <hi>Proverbs</hi> 4, 16.</q>) commanding all that inhabite that village, that they appeare next morning very early.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Miniſters and they appeare, they read
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:169711:92"/> 
                  <hi>Caeſars</hi> Edict, and aske them whether they would ſubmit thereto, to which they anſwer; That they rely wholly upon the will of God, whom in the Goſpell ef Jeſus Chriſt they ſerve, relying therefore on Gods will and pleaſure, they did reſolve to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe what puniſhment they would inflict, ſince they ſuffered onely for the name of Jeſus Chriſt, not for any ill deeds. Againe they demanded whether they will repent, and returne to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke Church from which through ſchiſme and haereſie they had departed. Vnanimouſly they doe deny it. The Commiſsaries diſmiſs them, having given them ſome time to conſider of it, and that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one particularly might come in and ſpeake for himſelfe; but they repeat againe their common an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that in ſo religious a cauſe as this there needed no deliberation. Therefore the Commiſsioners in <hi>Caeſars</hi> name baniſh them, and command them to depart out of the City within eight dayes, under the paine of death. Theſe godly men did obey, and went into baniſhment, for whom the Baron at his owne charge tooke care, that they ſhould be carried into Hungary.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Going afterwards into Wienna the Baron complaines unto <hi>Caeſar</hi> of the injurie done unto him by the Cardinall in Moravia, and the Prince of Litch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſteine in Bohemia, (for there he had a town with ſome villages, and the Miniſters were there alſo caſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="1">I. THe judiciall proceeding being over, which laſted for the ſpace almoſt of three days, each ſort of priſoners were carried to their ſeverall priſons, the Noblemen into the inner priſon of the Caſtle, the Citizens into the Praetors houſes. Some rakeſhames were ſuborned to inſult over them, ſaying, why do they not now ſing <hi>The Lord reigneth.</hi> The ninety ninth Pſalm, as it ſhould ſeem being, uſed to be ſung amongſt other Pſalms in the time of <hi>Frederick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Prince <hi>Lichſtenſtein</hi> going out of his Pallace, and going to Maſs that day, as well as the next day following, the wives, children and the kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk of each ſex of the condemned perſons humbly ſuing for their lives; but anſwer was made, that all the favour that they could now expect was that they ſhould have leave to bury the corps of their friends. And yet there were ſome inſinuating fellowes, ſuch as would ſwallow bribes, who tooke monies both of widdowes and orphans, making faire promiſes to them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In the evening the condemned men had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice given to them, that the time of their execution drew
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:169711:98"/> neare, and that the one and twentieth day of <hi>Iune</hi> was the appointed day: And therefore they did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice that each of them would have a care of his owne ſoule, and therefore that they ſhould ſend for a Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite, or Capuchin, or Miniſter of the Auguſtine Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and ſo fit himſelfe for death; but that none of them muſt have any thought to have any Miniſter of the Order; becauſe that would not be granted unto them. Which was ſad newes to them; becauſe the greater part of the Martyres had beene auditors of the Brethren: neither could this inhibition otherwiſe be taken, than either from ſome exact or ſome anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent rooted malice againſt them; or to caſt a miſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the eyes of the Saxons, as though <hi>Caeſar</hi> did not much diſlike their Order.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Which thing being done, the foreſaid Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites and the Capuchines, not ſtaying till they were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>alled for, flew thither like ſo many flies, uſing many perſwaſions to them, even to deſparation and deniall of the truth, and by putting ſome in hope of life. But God ſo ſtrengthned them, that all thoſe endeavours of Sathan and his Imps were in vaine, whatſoever they proteſted to the contrary; calling Heaven and Earth to witneſs, that they ſhall not be guilty of their eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall damnation, ſince that they ſo obſtinately refuſed the Grace of God.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Miniſters of the Goſpell are therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>Iohannes Roſucius</hi> from the leſser Prague went to
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:169711:99"/> the Caſtle, M. <hi>Victorinus Verberius,</hi> and <hi>Vitus Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſſius</hi> into the Court in old Prague. <hi>Adamus Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens</hi> into new Prague. And <hi>David Lippech</hi> was with the Germans, whereof three which were at this time condemned were doctors. <hi>Jeſſenius, Haunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>childt and Rippell:</hi> Theſe Divines ſpent the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of time (which was Sunday and Munday even unto the time of execution in religious exerciſe col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquies, prayers and Hymnes; laſtly they did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the holy Martyrs by the adminiſtration of the Sacrament for the future agony.</p>
               <p n="6">6. They which were of the Brethren and refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, did admit thoſe Miniſters willingly, proteſting that they have acknowledged them for brethren, and do acknowledge them to be the Embaſſadors of Chriſt, howſoever they have differed unhappily in ſome Articles. Two onely, the Baron of Budovia, and <hi>Otto</hi> of Loſs, conferred religiouſly with <hi>Roſacius,</hi> but did not partake of the Sacrament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe happily it might give occaſion of ſome falſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation) comforting themſelves with this ſaying <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and thou hast eaten.</hi>

               <p n="7">7. It is worthy remembrance, how on the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day they which were in old Prague priſoners in the Praetors houſe did ſuppe. For as they were confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with M. <hi>Werbenius,</hi> and even in his preſence, the chiefe Goaler had told them that the hour for ſupper was at hand, they looking one upon another, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:169711:99"/> that they did not want that materiall ſupper, yet for recreation ſake they would not ſcorne to ſit down. And then one is buſie laying the Napkins, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

One of theſe <hi>D. Haunſchildt,</hi> would eat nothing: ſaying, <hi>this pouch meaning his panch) is ſufficiently stuffed with wormes meat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. In the mean while it is told them that the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons and Noblemen, were led out of the priſon of the Caſtle into the Court of the ancient City, near unto which in the market place that direful Theatre for that ſhambles was appointed: which they, as if they were going to meet with them, haſten to the windows, and looking out entertaine their fellow Martyrs with the forty fourth Pſalm with a loud voyce, while the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:169711:100"/> amazed multitude flock after them in great ſwarms, ſighing and lamenting.</p>
               <p n="9">9. After that, the whole night is ſpent in Pſalms and prayers, and godly diſcourſe, and mutuall exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations: (that becauſe it pleaſed God to call them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore others, to this glory of Martyrdome,) they ſhould not doubt, by their true conſtancy, to confound the world, to glorifie Chriſt, and to leave a godly example to poſterity. And when amongſt others they ſung the ſixty eight Pſalm, (occaſion being taken by the laſt verſe of that Pſalm, where <hi>David</hi> prayes, <hi>Shew ſome token of good upon me,) John Kutnaur</hi> broke out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe words, <hi>Shew therefore on us ſome token of thy goodneſſe O God, whereby we thy unworthy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants may be ſtrengthned by thy goodneſſe, and our enemies confounded.</hi> And as it were anſwering for God, being full of faith, he ſaith, <hi>Be of good cheare, for even in this God hath heard your voyce, and to morrow he will ſhew ſome wonderfull ſigne, and will witneſſe that we ſuffer for his cauſe.</hi> The Miniſter, M. <hi>Werbenius</hi> when he heard this, anſwered, <hi>They will rest ſatisfied herewith, when they ſhall perceive that death which is bitter to the wicked, is ſweetned to you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. Early in the morning, having waſhed their Faces, they put on clean clothes, as though they were going to a wedding, fitting their Dublets and jackets to their bodies, and cutting their collars,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:169711:100"/> that being brought to the ſcaffold, there ſhould bee no need of a new making ready. <hi>Kautnur,</hi> in the meane while, with others pray and earneſtly deſire of God, that if his Majeſty would bee pleaſed to ſtrengthen and confirme both themſelves and the people concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their innocence. And preſently after the ſun ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, a beautifull bow appeared and compaſſed the heavens, the Miniſters, the ſouldiers, and many others, go to ſee it. But the Martyrs looked out at the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow and they all ſee, (as well as thoſe all over Prague) a Rain-bow of an unuſuall colour, and the Heavens very clear, neither was it obſerved that any rain had fallen for the ſpace of two whole dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. This ſign being ſhewed from heaven, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs lifted up their voices and hands, part of them in whoſe company <hi>Verbenius</hi> was, fell on their knees and praiſed God, here one calls to mind the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of <hi>Noah,</hi> another thinketh one the Rain-bow in the Revelation, about the Throne of Chriſts tribunall, who was judge of the living and the dead, and very much to comfort themſelves herein.</p>
               <p n="11">11. But as ſoone as this heavenly ſign of grace was vaniſhed, another ſign of approaching Martyrdome, the noiſe of a gun, being let off, ſounded in their ears, which when being heard by the Miniſters of the word, the Champions of Chriſt, going to each other, ſalute one another, and pray that each of them may bee ſtrengthned, they alſo encourage one another,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:169711:101"/> and exhort to fight manfully, preſently the Troops of horſe come, and ſome colours of footmen, and encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe the Theater, wherein, on their ſeats, the Judges of <hi>Caeſar</hi> with the Senators did ſit; the Market place, the ſtreets, and al the houſes, are filled with num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſſe numbers of ſpectators,</p>
               <p n="12">12. The Martyrs are called forth one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and do go to their death, and undergo it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out daunting, for whoever was called forth, haſtned with no leſſe chearfullneſſe, than as if he had gone to a banquet, or ſome other delights; and it was done af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame manner by each of them, (as M. <hi>Roſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> doth deſcribe) ſpeaking to the other. <hi>Moſt lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving friends farewell, God give unto you the comfort of his Spirit, patience and courage, that what for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly with your heart, your mouth, and your hands, ye have affirmed, ye may do the like by your glorious death, behold I goe before, that I may ſee the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of my Lord Jeſus Chriſt, ye will follow me, that we may together behold the face of our Father, even in this hour all ſorrow departs from me, and joy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p n="13">13. Theſe and other things, being accompanied by the Miniſters, through the yard of the Court, to the Scaffold, they ſpake with a brave reſolution, and with ſuch ardency of Spirit, that even the Praetors, and the company of Souldiers, ſtandtng round about wept, and had they not deafned the ears of the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanders with the noiſe of Drums, and ſound of Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, it had been impoſſible but that every one had paid the tribute of one teare if not more. When the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters returned, and had reported how valiantly the one and other died, the reſt prayſed God, deſiring of him the like aid of his aſſiſting Grace.</p>

Would ye were aſſertained of your ſalvation as I am of mine, the Lord be praiſed, who by his holy ſpirit, hath aſſured me of my ſalvation by the bloud of the Lambe. The Jeſuite replyed, Good ſir, do not preſume too much, and aſſume that to your ſelfe, whereof no man can promiſe to himſelfe any certainty; For doth not the Scripture ſay, No man knowes whether hee have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved grace? To whom the Baron anſwered, Is it therefore that I have need of your mercy?

This was the cauſe why the ſentence of death was pronounced againſt him, becauſe he was preſent at the expedition of the Orders in Auſtria, and not being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved of his former Oath took an oath to be true to <hi>Frederick,</hi> which thing was as wel done by others as by him, ſo that it was evident, that theſe Politicians ſought their pretences, meerly out of the hatred they did bear unto religion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Going to ſuffer, he called unto him <hi>Roſacius,</hi> a Miniſter of the Goſpell, and told him how much he was troubled for his wife and children, for hee knew his wives coldneſſe in religion, and therefore feared what hee ſhould commit to her, ſhee now wanting a counſellour. He remembers that he left in witing ſomething with her, which he doth deſire to remember, and therefore deſirteh the Miniſter to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe them to him.

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:169711:106"/> allurements to be perſwaded from it: for he tels ther that therein is the readieſt and moſt infallible way of Salvation, and aſſurance of the mercy of God by the merits of Chriſt, being mindful of him &amp; of that which ſhe had heard from him, that he had tried all Religion, and compared them with the Scriptures, and that he found none more ſure &amp; ſolid, than that which he was about to ſeal with his bloud, that we attain Salvation by the bloud of the Lamb, which he is certain very ſhortly to find. Of which glory if ſhe would be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, ſhe ſhould perſevere in the ſame faith. Secondly, he prayed that ſhe would uſe more clemency to his Subjects, and rather eaſe, then overcharge them with burthens; laſt of all to command that ſhe would have a care of her Children and bring them up in pure Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, otherwiſe if through careleſneſſe they were ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, he would cauſe them to appeare before Chriſt his tribunal. This he ſpake with much zeal and ſolemn proteſtations; but this meer woman, being perfidious to God, her conſcience, her children, and her ſubjects, obſerving nothing of all this. For within a while after ſhe did marry an Apoſtate, committed her ſonnes to the tuition of Jeſuites, ſhe her ſelf ſwerved from her Religion, and did exerciſe tyranny over the ſoules and bodies of her ſubjects.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Being called forth to execution, he ſaid, I have travelled ſo many Countries, ſo many barbarous na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tions, have undergone ſo many dangers by ſea and-

               <p n="1">I. VVHen <hi>Roſacius</hi> the Miniſter of the Word came to viſit him after his condemnation, he received him with tears in his eyes, but with a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heart, with theſe words; <hi>Behold me a miſerable old man, who have often intreated my God, that hee would have compaſsion on me, and take me out of this life, but</hi> I <hi>have not obtained it; For God hath reſerved me to be a ſpectacle in the world, and a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to himſelf. Let Gods will be done. My death indeed is diſgracefull in the eyes of men, but glorious in the ſight of God: for God will account that death precious in his ſight, which</hi> I <hi>ſuffer for his glory and truth.</hi> And when the Miniſter would have comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, he deſired him to heare his confeſſion, and to pronounce his abſolution, and to have that faith and hope which he had in God ſtrengthened by the Lords Supper. Having therefore confeſſed himſelfe a ſinner, but eſpecially that in his youth he committed ſomething according to the cuſtome of that age, to pleaſe the world he prayſed God that had not ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to be ſwallowed up, but had called him to a more holy and upright courſe of life.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:169711:108"/>2. At length he ſaid, [Through the mercy of my God I have preſerved my truſt and conſcience, both to God, my King, and Country. I have faithfully ſerved four Emperours, and that now ſuch a reward ſhould be given unto me, I leave to God the juſt Judge, who knowes that I ſought not either honour or riches, by any thing which I did in this buſineſſe. But I could not winke at the oppreſſion of liberty and Religion: and becauſe wee ſaw our ſelves circumvented by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty, wee thought ſomething was to bee done; and would rather loſe our lives, rather than by a dull ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence yeeld to the yoke, and betray poſterity. I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg that it was the will of God that we ſhould outwardly fall, who hath choſen me and my belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved fellowes in this laſt age to honour the truth by our bloud, and to make it glorious by our conſtancy. And although the fleſh began to tremble at the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſentence of death, yet now by the goodneſſe of God, I feel no feare of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. When the Miniſter often interrupted him, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading him not to hang his ſalvation upon a good Conſcience, but upon the mercy of God thiough Chriſt, the pious old man continued on his ſpeech. [Yeſterday it was told me from my Aunt <hi>Pruako<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi> that if I would petition <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="205" facs="tcp:169711:108"/> and inconvenient. For if I ſhould deſire pardon, I ſhould give an occaſion to ſome, to ſuſpect that I had committed ſome crime, and had deſerved death, which I have not deſerved. Tell her therefore, that I will deſire pardon of him againſt whom I have committed many ſinnes all my life: but I never offended the Prince. But if they ſhould of their owne accord of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer me a priſon inſtead of death, ſuch a change would be very troubleſome. I am a decrepit old man, and have lived long enough; for when I cannot diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the taſts of meats, or reliſh the ſweetneſſe of drinke, when it is tedious to ſit long, and irkeſome to lye, when I cannot walk unleſſe I lean on a ſtaffe, or be moved to and fro in others hands; what profit (I pray you) would ſuch a life be to me? And if I can hardly endure it while it is free, how ſhall I be able to ſuffer impriſonment? God forbid that J ſhould be pulled from this holy company of Martyrs.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The next day (being the Lords day) having received the Lords Supper. he ſaid, [Behold now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reconciled to my God through Chriſt, I have peace, neither doe I feare man.

<pb n="206" facs="tcp:169711:109"/> to piety, and to imitate that conſtancy whereof they ſee an example in me: although J know that you who are the fathers and ſhepheards of our ſouls are not without danger. We go before, but you wil follow: but God keep you for his own glory, and let him not ſuffer his Church to be wholly tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled on by the Babiloniſh beaſt.</p>
               <p n="5">5. On the day of execution, when the Miniſter of the word came to him, hee ſaid: J had laid this miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable body upon a bed; but what ſleep could J have? Yet J did ſleep, and ſaw two Angels comming to me, who wiped my face with fine linnen, and exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me to be ready to goe along with them. But J truſt in my God that J have theſe Angels preſent with me, not by a dream, but in truth, which miniſter to me while J live; and ſhall carry my ſoule from death into <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome. For although J am a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, yet I am purged by the bloud of my Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, who was made a Propitiation for our ſinnes. Therefore let the houre of Death come, J am pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Having put on his clothes he comanded that a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the fineſt linnen, which hung down to his heels ſhould be put over him, and then ſaid to <hi>M. Lippuch,</hi> Behold I put on my wedding garment. To which the other anſwered. The garment of Chriſts righteouſneſſe adorns more gloriouſly within. He anſwered again, I know it, but yet I deſire to be adorned without, for the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:169711:109"/> honour of my Bride-groom. At laſt hee put on a vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet Cloak, and being called out, he anſwered: In the name of God; for I did even now expect it. And then being helped by his ſervants, hee aroſe and bid farewell to all, and went away with a ſlow pace, by reaſon of the weakneſſe of age. Being to go down by certain ſteps to the ſcaffold, he ſayd. <hi>Oh my God ſtrengthen me left</hi> I <hi>fall down and become a matter of ſcorn to the enemies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. When he came to the appointed place, he had much ado to kneele downe, being half crooked. Hee deſired that that the Executioner might be adviſed to ſtrike as ſoon as ever hee ſhould ſee him lie down, leſt hee might happen to fall by faintneſſe. But the Executioner ſeeing him ſo crooked, and to hang down his head ſo much would not ſtrike him. Therefore the Miniſter <hi>Roſacius</hi> by the appointment of the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs, ſaid to him. My Noble Lord, as you have commended your ſoul unto Chriſt, ſo now offer up your hoary head cheerefully to God, and lift up your ſelf towards heaven. In the name of God an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered hee, and ſo lifting up his head as well as hee could, ſaith, Lord Jeſus into thy hands J commend my ſpirit; and then his head being cut off hee fell down.</p>

And while he put off his cloathes, hee gave his purſe with an Hungarian Ducket to the Miniſter of the word: Behold here my laſt riches, and theſe which are unprofitable for mee, I reſigne to you.</p>

But this was onely a pretence.

But he ſeparated himſelf from them at the Communion, and kneeled downe, and prayed ſo fervently by himſelfe, as was an aſtoniſhment unto the reſt. When every thing was ended, the reſt gave thanks to the Miniſter, and he brake out into theſe words; J alſo give thankes to my God, who would have mee here preſent, and for you, my beloved friends, I heartily rejoice at this pious and holy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for death. <hi>Roſacius</hi> anſwered; And to you my Lord, the way of Gods grace was open, and we hoped, that after you had profeſſed the ſame faith with us, and had admitted of abſolution, that you would have ſubſcribed the Teſtament of Chriſt, &amp;c. He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered: That might, and perhaps ought to have beene done. But! And at this word holding his peace, hee ſtruck his breaſt, ſighed and wept, and afterwards added: J reſt in that grace, which hath happened unto me: and J truſt in my God, that he will graciouſly accept my contrite ſpirit. It was certaine, that he had repoſed ſome hope in the favour of men, of which he was deprived.</p>

For hee turned himſelfe from the kiſſe of peace (as they call it) and turned his backe to the ſigne of the croſſe; and falling downe on his face he prayed ſoftly: afterwards lifting up himſelfe and looking up to heaven, he cried out.

But we will not fall downe and deſire favour, lest we give to man that honour which is due to God, and betray our own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency.

<pb n="217" facs="tcp:169711:114"/> and in that we are overcome and condemned to die, we acknowledge, that God will not have his Truth defended by ſwords, but by our bloud.

Thou knoweſt that I reſigne my ſelfe wholly to thee. Ah doe not deſpiſe thy ſervant, but make hast to take me away.</hi> The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter having eſpied the Sheriffe returning, told him, That that glory which he made ſuch haſt unto, was now preſent; for now they come to call you.

               <p>AN eminent Citizen of <hi>Prague,</hi> and famous for pleading in the Courts of the Kingdom, whoſe Councell the States had uſed for many yeares. He upon the taking of <hi>Prague</hi> was taken at his own houſe, and ſcoffed at by the Souldiers, who had the poſſeſſion of the whole houſe, beaten with their fiſts, and at length by an unheard of and exquiſite kind of torture, he was ſo cruelly burnt even to the privy parts, that for ſix moneths
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:169711:124"/> being troubled with moſt grievous pains, he could neither live nor die. When the reſt were impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the 21. of February, he was brought from his own houſe firſt, into the Court of the old City, and from thence carried into a Tower of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, which they call the <hi>White-Tower,</hi> and there ſhut up from all company. Laſtly the 7. of <hi>June</hi> he was found dead in the Caſtle-Ditch under that Tower.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The enemies reported, that being driven in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to deſpaire by the remembrance of his wickedneſs, he had thrown himſelf down headlong; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they commanded, that he ſhould be taken by the Executioner, carried into the White-mountain, and there beheaded, and quartered, his entrailes to be buried, and the other parts to be ſet upon ſtaves in the four quarters of the world before the City, and his head to be faſtned to a Gibbet in the Horſe-market. But it ſeemed doubtfull to many how he could throw himſelf down, being always guarded by Souldiers. It is moſt likely that he was caſt down by ſome privily deſign'd to that purpoſe, which God knowes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This one thing is not unknown to us, that he was troubled with great temptations all that time. For when being confin'd to his houſe, the Miniſter of the word (<hi>Adam Hartman</hi> with Dr. <hi>Eraſmus</hi> a Phyſician then with him) did viſit him,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:169711:124"/> he heard theſe words proceed from him, <hi>O my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> Adam, <hi>I hoped that in theſe late tranſactions, I was ſerviceable to God and the Church. Now ſeeing the event contrary, and conſidering how great a ſlaughter of many thouſand men there hath been, I think that we have done ſomething erroneouſly which hath diſpleaſed God.</hi> The coming of the Souldiers interrupted him being about to ſpeak more: and he deſiring them to viſit him againe, before that could be done, he was removed into the aforeſaid Tower of the Caſtle, none being afterwards admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him, but his Wife ſometimes; Who viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him the day before his death being the 6. of <hi>June,</hi> (which ſhe often afterwards related) found him very ſad, and troubled by the <hi>Monkes,</hi> which did infeſt him (as he complain'd) and deſiring comfort, there lay by chance upon the Table, a great Cantionall of the Brethrens, to which reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out his hand, <hi>Seeke</hi> ſaith he, <hi>comforts for my ſoul,</hi> She not being able preſently to ſatisfie his deſire, he opened it himſelf, and ſung theſe verſes with weeping out of the penitentiall ſong which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the letter G. XVIII. where God is brought in ſpeaking to the contrite ſoule (out of 30. <hi>Jer.</hi> 15. <hi>Why cryeſt thou for thine affliction? Thy ſorrow is incurable, there is none to help, (out of the</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 14, 26.) I <hi>will bind up thy wound, and heale thy ſtripes and will not take away my chaſtiſement till</hi> I <hi>have
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:169711:125"/> healed thee.</hi> Then he continued in the Apoſtrophe which was in the ſame ſong. <hi>Lift up thy ſelf thou beleeving ſoul, who art caſt down with a ſence of thy ſinne and miſery! He is faithfull that hath promiſed, who hath partly fulfilled his promiſe, having ſent a Phyſitian to thee,</hi> viz. <hi>his ſonne, who hath by his own bloud provided a plaiſter for thy ſore. He will reſtore thee to the full, when he ſhall raiſe thee up and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie thee, &amp;c.</hi> Which are all ſignes of a ſoul wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with deſpaire though not as yet deſpairing.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But although he had perhaps caſt himſelf down for a fear of greater evills, or with a hope to eſcape a reſolution to dye; yet the glory of Martyrdom doth not periſh with them, who (as long as it is Chriſts cauſe) fearing the enemies fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, do themſelves anticipate death; which may be made probable to the Papiſts themſelves, by the authority of the Fathers, to whom they in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſes attribute much. Let them look upon <hi>Ambroſe</hi> (in his third book of Virgins) relating ſuch a thing of the Virgin <hi>Pelagia,</hi> &amp; alſo prayſing the deed. Let them reſort to <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> although he anſwers more doubtfully of the like buſineſſe. But ſomething may be had out of <hi>Euſebius</hi> to cauſe a milder opinion, who in the 8. Book 12. <hi>ch.</hi> writes thus, <hi>What need we revive the memory of thoſe who were burnt at</hi> Antioch <hi>with hot coals not to death, but to lengthen out the puniſhmet?</hi> (which alſo happened
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:169711:125"/> to <hi>Freweynius) And of others who would ſooner put their right hands into the fire then touch the prophane ſacrifice? The tryall of which ſome avoiding, throwes themſelves headlong from the houſe-tops, before they would be taken and fall into the enemies hands; and thought rather to haſten their death then to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo the malice of wicked men.</hi> More may be there ſeene.</p>

               <p>AMong the condemned perſons was <hi>Matthias Borbonius,</hi> a moſt excellent and ſuccesfull Phyſitian, being chief Phyſician to three Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours; whom when the Prince <hi>Lichtenſtein</hi> knew to be innocent, of the civill broyles, he obtained his pardon, and entertained him for his chief Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician. But that exceedingly vexed his enemies, eſpecially the Imperiall Judge <hi>John Chryſoſtome Schrepelius,</hi> who induced by the hope of gain (for he gaped for <hi>Borbonius</hi> his ſtately houſes) had laden him with ſlanders. He therefore no longer able to conceale his diſſembled rancour gave com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to the Sergeants, to ſet upon <hi>Borbonius</hi> in the ſtreete of the City as he returned from the Prince, and to beat him with their clubs even to

               <p n="2">2. This Phyſician is rightly accounted among the Confeſſors of the truth, although he obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not a Crown of Martyrdom. For as often as the Prince or ſome privatly ſtirred up, dealt with him ſeriouſly about changing his Religion (which they often did) yet it was always in vaine. His anſwer to <hi>Smeczanius</hi> is remarkable; For when he intreated him with moſt eloquent words, and even with imbraces above his ordinary courteſie, that he would turn Roman-Catholick, ſaying, <hi>Ah my</hi> Borbonius, <hi>how much mighteſt thou promote the Catholick cauſe, and the ſalvation of many by your example!</hi> He replyed, <hi>There is nothing more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, then that I ſhould diſadvantage your Church if I ſhould become a Member,</hi> When he ask'd the reaſon, he anſwered him, <hi>Let your Honour thinke, that my Conſcience is ſo tender that it will not by any meanes ſuffer any violence to be uſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. If</hi> I <hi>ſhould therefore revolt when that ſpeaks to the contrary,</hi> I <hi>can expect nothing from it but gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and rendings, and torments which will drive me headlong into deſpair. And I departing with roaring and what honor ſhould</hi> I <hi>be made elſe but an example for others to take heed of the ſame precipicies?</hi> When he ſaw him ſo unmoveable, he began to hate him,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:169711:126"/> and with others (in the year 1623.) baniſhed him the Kingdome.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Borbonius</hi> then went into Poland and was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the King himſelf to practice Phyſick, and at length he departed this life being an old man of 70 years of age at Thorun in Pruſſia in the year 1629, 16 of December.</p>

               <p n="3">3. It was preſently forbidden by Letters Patents ſent through all the Lordſhips, that no man ſhould diminiſh or waſt his Goods by ſelling any of them, or by any other pretence tranſlating them to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but ſhould poſſeſs them as he did at that preſent. A penalty was impoſed upon thoſe that ſhould do otherwiſe; that whatſoever any man ſhould ſend to another place ſhould bee loſt, and that whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver received any thing of another mans ſhould pay ſo much of his own to the Emperour.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Many were afterwards cited one after another to receive their final ſentence even ſome that were dead (as the L. <hi>Nicholas Bukowski de Huſteizan</hi> purged two years before, &amp;c.) others that had been for many years bed-ridden, ſome that were blind who could not in any thing offend, whoſe names were found in the Regiſters of the Kingdom, and who were thought to be rich, which happened to the Lord <hi>Peter Skopek</hi> of Otradowitz Lord of Belehrade, and the Lord <hi>Iohn Charvat</hi> of Bieloſſesky: to whoſe charge this crime was laid, that they had been preſent in the
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:169711:129"/> expedition of the States at Vienna, and had ſhot bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets againſt the Emperors window: of whom one had loſt the uſe of his eies ten yeares before, the other being ſick of the Palſie, could not move himſelf in his bed: by this it appeared that not ſo much the faults of the Proteſtants as their goods: And that appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that they made not ſo exact an inquiry unto men of a meaner eſtate: Yea (I tell a truth) thoſe merry Judges turned their wickedneſſe to a jeſt, and had it not ſeldome in their mouths, when any one had purged himſelfe of a fault in no wiſe committed by him, that although he had not actuall ſinnes, yet he was infected with Originall ſinne, hereſie, and wealth, and therefore could not bee exempt from pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. This was heard often from the mouth of Cardinall <hi>Ditrichſtein.</hi> That was ſome comfort to the Godly, that they ſuffered not as evil doers but as Chriſtians.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Then were but eight dayes given to thoſe that were warned to appear; when otherwiſe in the buſineſſe of mony a longer term was uſually granted. Thoſe that did appear, had the Articles of the crimes read to them, not onely according to the confeſſion publiſhed, but whatſoever might be ſlanderouſly framed againſt any man. Neither was time given or permitted to anſwer: but if any one would offer, or had offered to purge himſelf, he was commanded to hear his definitive ſentence in that place. The form
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:169711:129"/> of which was: That he had incurred the loſſe of life honour and goods, but by the grace of the Imperial Majeſty life and honour was given to him, but onely his Goods hee owed to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> whether every far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing or onely a halfe, third, or a fourth part, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="6">6. So that it had an appearance of mercy, that all were not deprived of all their Goods, but the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of the execution ſhewed it to bee meer cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For they tooke from the poſſeſſors all the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, Townes, and Villages giving them a paper for that which was left, whereby they were commanded to expect the payment of their part from the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. But no man hath as yet ſeen a farthing of any payment, and ſo by the proceſſe of law, the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants were deprived of their goods after a Tyrannical manner, and driven into ſtrange places, ſome were freely received through the Cities, others betooke themſelves to their kindred, and friends of the Popiſh Religion, others became ſervants to the deſtroyers of their own goods: few of them kept their own and their wives goods for a time by the favor of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners by bribes, or by a ſecond lying, it increaſed there cruelty, not only their immoveable Goods were taken away, but there moveables alſo were ſequeſtred, ſcarce having ſo much as a garment left wherewith to cloath them, for example ſake, <hi>Burjan Slebowſki</hi> may be named, and that did not happen to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:169711:130"/> but to many others who returning home at that very time when the Commiſſioners had entred his houſe to confiſcate his goods, he was commanded to alight, and told that his coach and horſes with theſe cheſts muſt be ſeized on for the Emperour.</p>
               <p n="7">7. And becauſe they thought that many had mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny at uſe, that they might alſo ſqueeze out this, they commanded that every man ſhould bring what bonds he had, upon pain of loſing the whole ſumme, if any one did but conceale the leaſt. In Moravia there was a peculiar judicature erected for this thing, which they called <hi>Grida,</hi> at Nulasbergh, where all were bound to appeare; ſome were reſtored whole, viz. thoſe of a leſſe value, for an appearance of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; others were ſuppreſsed for counterfeit reaſons; from others a part was ſet apart for the Emperour, If any certaine ſumme of money was broght u in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kingdomes Regiſter, according to the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed manner, the Kings Treaſurer was at hand (for all things were ſtuft with Traytors and Treaſons,) who proteſting that the Emperour had need of it, to defray the charges of the Warre, took it away, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to the Creditor a written note, to teſtifie that ſuch a ſumme was due to him from the Emperour.</p>
               <p n="8">8. So the ancient inhabitants being commanded to depart, thoſe that were addicted to the Popiſh Religion, divided the confiſcated goods among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as it was commodious for any of them to add
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:169711:130"/> this or that Village, Towne, Caſtle, or other Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to their owne bounds, and as they could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it from the Emperour as a gift, or upon any other account. The greateſt part fell to the ſhare of ſtrangers, Spaniards, Italians; Germans, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders of the Imperiall Army, inſtead of their pay.</p>
               <p n="9">9. If there remained any goods of Widdowes, or Wards that were not taken away by colour of Law, there ſcarce wanted <hi>Ahabs</hi> to covet <hi>Naboths</hi> vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard: For if any one was pleaſed with anothers mans ground, bordering on him, he would circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent him by craft, or allure him by promiſe as a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour or compell him by quartering Souldiers on him to ſell it. Whereas the buyers for the moſt part performed the part of pricers, cheapners, and contractors: obtruding ſuch a price on them as they themſelves liſted, and afterwards not paying it.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The Emperour commanded the Charter of the Kingdome granted by ancient Kings, to bee brougbt to him at Vienna, which when hee recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved (he ſaid) <hi>Are theſe the Papers which have procured ſo much trouble to our Ancestors?</hi> And viewing the ſeverall Parchments ſeals and ſubſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he rent them, and threw them into the fire. <hi>Adam de Waldstein</hi> Burgrave of Prague and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Officiall of the Kingdome, who brought them, ſtanding by aſtoniſhed and ſecretly ſighing.</p>

In the mean time when wicked men are like Euripus, neither can bee quiet, but caſt out mire and dirt, as the Prophet ſpeaks, it came to paſs that they invented a new kind of rage. By baniſhing the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of the truth by a peculiar writ: that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever of the Barons Noblemen or Citizens, did keep a Non-Catholick Tutor for their Children, ſhould preſently diſmiſs him: otherwiſe he ſhould bee taken and puniſhed.</p>

For they hoped that when the <hi>Provinces</hi> of <hi>Germany</hi> round about were ſubdued, and the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> with <hi>Mansfeild,</hi> and <hi>Winarienſis,</hi> and others were overcome, and upon that the hearts of many faint, it would come to paſſe that at length being ſtruck with this thunderbolt, moſt would forſake Religion, which happened accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</p>
               <p>In the year therefore 1627. July 31. (a day conſecrated to <hi>Ignatius Loyola,</hi> to witneſſe that it
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:169711:133"/> was coined by the Loyolites, as the firſt inventers, a ſolemne Mandate of the Emperours came forth, wherein he affirming hereſie to be the ſole cauſe of the ſo many miſeries of the ſometime flouriſhing Kingdome of Bohemia, whereby the minds of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants were as well divided among themſelves as from their Magiſtrates, and diverſe judgements of God drawn upon them, declares his will thus: We there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, our conſcience urging us, neither can nor will any longer tollerate any one of the inferiour, much leſſe ſuperiour States among all the ſubjects of our hereditary Kingdome of Bohemia of either ſex, who is infected with hereticall Errors. And therefore we do grant unto the ſame ſuperiour States the term of one ſix moneths to learn the holy and only ſaving Roman-catholick faith. And that there may not want ſome from whom they may ſufficiently draw ſaving inſtructions, and informations, we do upon our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious counſell, appoint certaine Commiſſioners of Reformation as well Civill as Eccleſiaſticall men. It was our pleaſure therefore by this publick act to aſſure all men of our Fatherly care, for the ſalvation of this Kingdome, as likewiſe to warn, that all and every perſon, making account both of his temporary and eternall ſalvation, would not fail to yield them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves obedient to our will, and to be diligently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by the afore-named Commiſſioners of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and unleſſe any man ſhall obey our will,

For wee Will, that all thoſe who are obſtinately ſtubborne, ſhall, ſelling their Goods among the Catholicks, depart out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Bohemia at the end of the terme, and never promiſe themſelves any return, unleſſe they turn Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Here one might ſee ſtrange alterations of minds and diverſities of Counſell. Thoſe that loved Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and conſtancy at their hearts, did inſtantly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate themſelves by baniſhment, others were troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and wavered ſeeking holes and hiding places, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciting <hi>Caeſar</hi> by Petitions either to change the decree or grant them a longer time or elſe indeavouring by words to obtaine it, as much as was in any mans power. There were not ſome wanting who preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the diſcomodities of baniſhment, poverty, age, ſickneſſe, duties, and every thing elſe, thought it beſt to ſatisfie the Emperours will. Others were found who thinking to deceive the Emperour and Pope did buy with their gold, falſe teſtimonies of the Prieſts, that they had performed confeſſion and communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in one kind. And it was ſo, that ſome did by thoſe bought bills, make a ſhew of diſſembled A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy and by that means avoided baniſhment.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But ſuch a Marchandize of ſoules did not proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per well with ſome. For <hi>Lawrence Niezburski,</hi>
                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:169711:134"/> Paſtor of Alberts in New-Prague, who did too freely uſe that impoſture, and for ſuch bills had ſcraped to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether a great ſumme of mony from the Citizens, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen, and Barons: being betrayed was taken, and with him above a hundred Citizens of Prague; who being all accuſed of Treaſon both to God and the Emperour, were adjudged to death. The Lay-men redeemed their lives with a pecuniary fine, and a true Apoſtacy: the falſe Prieſt was degraded and put to death in the market-place in old Prague, in the yeare 1631. the ſeventh of <hi>Aprill.</hi> But we muſt returne to thoſe feares which did ariſe upon the firſt publication of the Act for baniſhment.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The enemies having underſtood ſo great waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of minds, and conceiving ſome hope that more in tract of time would either be daſhed againſt the rock of diſpaire, or throwne downe headlong into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of doubts: obtaine of the Emperour that another ſix moneths may be added to the end of that terme. A new decree is thereupon publiſhed (Decemb. the 6. of the ſame yeare 1627.) whereby a longer time of ſtaying within the bounds of their country is granted, but yet ſharper than before; for all were forced to imbrace the Romiſh religion, partly by promiſes, and partly by threats. Beſides the ſaid act of baniſhment is extended to Widows: Children onely are excepted, whether their mothers were alive or no, and commanded to be delivered to the care
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:169711:134"/> and inſtructions of Catholicks, or elſe to be ſhut up in Monaſteries. And this was a cauſe of many groanes and teares to the godly, when their Noblemens Sonnes and Daughters (even marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ageable mayds) we pulled from the lapp of their Mothers, Aunts and Uncles, and thruſt into the Jeſuites Colledges, or the <hi>Monkes</hi> cells: Their goods were taken out of the hands of their lawful tutors, and managed by Papiſts.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The fawning craftineſſe of theſe ſeducers, whereby they deceived unwary perſons, and did more hurt then by their rigour and terrours. As often as any one that did well know the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of religion, came before theſe reformers to be examined, they granted many things, and permitted moſt of the foundations to be believed, yea even the Article concerning juſtification by faith: ſaying that this one thing was required of them, to give obedience to the Church, and to acknowledge the <hi>Roman</hi> Biſhop to be a viſible Head of the Church, ſeeing it was neceſſary for good orders ſake; ſo the ſimpler ſort ſuppoſing that they were not conſtrained to any other faith then that which they had learnt, thought they might with a ſafe conſcience promiſe that outward obedience. If they ſaw any one ſprung from a more noble family, or to be either the ſole, or with a few others, remainder of the race, or in
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:169711:135"/> any otherwiſe delicate, and they ſuggeſted to them how much it grieved his Imperiall Majeſty, that thoſe ancient families which formerly were the ornaments and props of their Countrey, ſhould run themſelves into the danger of baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment through meer unadviſedneſſe, that it would be better for them to remain and flouriſh under the favour both of God and <hi>Caeſar.</hi> By theſe and the like Stratagems of Satan, there was a great ruine of the Proteſtant Nobility, all of them, who thought their earthly Countrey better then the heavenly; or whoſe conſciences were ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified by their ſubtilties, ſliding into apoſtaſie or hypocriſie.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Notwithſtanding about a hundred families of both Sexes that lov'd heavenly things above earthly, (and who did reverence that command of the heavenly Emperour, <hi>Come out of Babylon my people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>) leaving their inheritances, and all their poſſeſſions went away. Some were diſperſed through the neighbouring Provinces. <hi>Votland, Miſaia, Luſatia, Sileſia, Poland, Hungary;</hi> ſome who were more eaſily able to endure the troubles of baniſhment, went as farre as <hi>Pruſſia, Ruſſia,</hi> and <hi>Tranſylvania.</hi> Among theſe was the goodly old man <hi>Charles de Zerotine:</hi> who only could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain leave to ſtay in his Countrey all the dayes of his life, if he would deprive himſelfe of the holy
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:169711:135"/> worſhip of God, or covertly uſe it: yet he would rather be afflicted with the people of God, then enjoy temporary profits. Having ſold his poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions (but for halfe the price, a part of which alſo they extorted from him under colour of a certain Sute and Judgement, and other devices) he departed with <hi>Caeſars</hi> knowledge and leave to <hi>Preſland</hi> in <hi>Sileſia:</hi> but a little after a Declaration was annexed to the Imperiall letters, that if the Baron would depart from that City, it ſhould be lawfull for him to go whither he would, ſo that he came not back into the Emperours Provinces, or went not to the Emperours enemies.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The Enemies in the mean time not vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing ſuch as had departed out of their Countrey, the name of baniſhed perſons, called them <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parters,</hi> either in ſcorne, or elſe to upbraid their headineſſe (as not being ejected by <hi>Caeſar,</hi> but being blinded by meer obſtinacy, had paſſed out of their Countrey.) But when as they could not endure them in baniſhment, a proclamation came forth (in the yeare 1628. <hi>Auguſt</hi> the 18th.) wherein the Emperour accuſing the perverſity of ſome, who had departed from <hi>Bohemia</hi> and <hi>Moravia,</hi> into <hi>Sileſia,</hi> &amp; <hi>Luſatia</hi> only, <hi>proteſted that it was not his intention to remove thoſe obſtinate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons out of Bohemia, and to ſuffer them in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated Provinces. And therefore he commanded
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:169711:136"/> them to depart, otherwiſe they ſhould be brought to puniſhment. Alſo by the ſame edict they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to ſend hack thoſe children which they had carried with them, upon the penalty of looſing all the goods which any of them could require in his Countrey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. Preſently after another Act is publiſhed, <hi>whereby the Non-Catholick wives of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks were commanded to be puniſhed with baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, unleſſe they did repent.</hi> But when none (for no example is extant) would not ſuffer themſelves to be frighted, and ſome of the prime and chiefe Officers of the Kingdome had Proteſtant wives, and could not endure divorces; leave was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for them to ſtay. And an edict came forth (the firſt of <hi>May,</hi> in the year 1629.) <hi>whereby they were tolerated till the death of their husbands, and then ſhould be excluded from the inheritance, and ſent into baniſhment; in the meane time they ſhould be abſent from all nuptiall and feſtivall ſolemnities, or elſe ſhould take the loweſt place after the Catholicks.</hi> This was to ſtrike terrour into them.</p>
               <p n="10">10 But the Emperour had added expreſly this clauſe to the firſt Act (1627. the 31. of <hi>July) Leſt that any man ſhould think theſe things to be done for money, or depriving any man of his goods, and not for the ſole honour and glory of God, and the ſalvation of the ſoules of our Subjects; we
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:169711:136"/> declare in his part our clemency, that if any will be refractary to our gracious will (which we hope not) he ſhall have leave to depart quietly, and without any imbezlement of his goods. We do therefore promiſe, that if any one cannot ſell his goods within the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid terme of ſix moneths, or get in his debts (in the getting of which we wiſh that all the Courts be a help to him) he may chooſe any one of his kindred, or any other Catholick perſon, whom he may appoint and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh with full power for the ſelling his goods, and recovering his debts, &amp;c.</hi> Which thing had ſuch a colour of juſtice, joyned with clemency, that not only the baniſhed perſons did thankfully accept that moderation of the rigour, but alſo it did beguile forraigners, making them think that nothing had happened to the <hi>Bohemians</hi> worſe then that departure. But theſe were but words.</p>
               <p n="11">11. For firſt, what could they ſell when as all things had been taken from them under the name of fines? Beſides, if any had retained any lands, whom ſhould they ſell it to in this fury of warre, and almoſt a univerſall departure? For thoſe who remained were reduced to extreme po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty; and the Papiſts, although well monied, did not do this that they might furniſh the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed perſons with proviſion, but drive them by deſpaire to apoſtaſie Beſides, if any offered to buy, they would ſcarce give halfe the price. And
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:169711:137"/> laſtly, there was ſcarce any one who would offer ready money, but papers and bonds, whereby no man could expect to avoid hunger among for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigners. Moſt therefore who had any villages, farmes, vineyards, or other grounds remaining, took this courſe, to commit their goods to the care of ſome friend (ſuch as could be got) who ſhould lay title to thoſe things as bought by them, and ſhould ſend ſomething every year to the true poſſeſſour out of the revenue. But as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one gathers ſticks from the fell'd oak, ſo in ſo great a liberty to commit any thing againſt thoſe that were condemned and baniſhed, it was eaſie to become malepart, and moſt knew by experience that thoſe to whom they had committed the managing of their affaires, were perfidious and falſe.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Some therefore privately returning labour'd divers wayes to order their buſineſſe for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: but as ſoon as that was known, commands were iſſued out to the Captains of ſeverall Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, that <hi>whomſoever of the Non-Catholicks they could apprehend (either thoſe who were not already departed, or who had returned) any where ſtaying, gathering corn, exporting it out of the Kingdom, or ſelling it, and receiving monies, they ſhould take care to ſeize on them, and arreſt them, ſending them into the chiefe Towns of their Diviſions, taking notice of
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:169711:137"/> every one his name, Chriſtian-name, and family. And they ſhould warne thoſe that had nouriſhed ſuch on their allegiance, and honour, to appear before the chiefe Officers of the Kingdome, in the Caſtle of Prague, &amp;c.</hi> Theſe were given at <hi>Prague</hi> the 11th. of <hi>September,</hi> in the year 1628. the ſaid com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands were reiterated to divers diviſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s the ſecond of <hi>November,</hi> and ſometimes alſo in the year fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, being 1629. At length the 20. of <hi>July</hi> in the year 1630. inſtruction was given, <hi>That knowing where any lay hid they ſhould ſecretly and ſuddenly attach them, and bring them priſoners:</hi> adding the reaſon, becauſe they obſtinately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted Gods will, and the Emperours.</p>
               <p n="13">13. But this was granted that whoſoever had any buſineſſe to diſpatch in the Kingdome, ſhould deſire leave to come back of the Commiſſioners of reformation: but what that leave was, and with what conditions it was limitted, will appear from the form which was this, <hi>The moſt illuſtrious and honourable Lords, the Lords Commiſſioners be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appointed for the worke of reformation in the Kingdom of</hi> Bohemia, <hi>by his Imperiall Majeſty, our moſt mercifull Lord: underſtand by letters for what end</hi> N.N. <hi>craves leave to return for a time into this Kingdom. Seeing therefore he hath afforded a good hope of himſelfe</hi> (but thus to others:) <hi>Seeing the Lords Commiſſioners conceive good hope of him)
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:169711:138"/> they grant his Petition, and give leave, and permit him with ſafe conduct to come hither freely and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly, and ſafely to diſpatch his buſineſſe, being mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted by no man upon the account of Religion, within the ſpace of ſix weeks. But with this expreſſe condition that preſently upon his entrance into the Kingdom, he appear before the moſt illuſtrious Lords Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, and recite what buſineſſe he hath to do, and within that time admit of inſtruction by ſpirituall men, pious and learned, that ſo being made a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Catholick Church by an humble confeſſion of ſins, and receiving the Sacrament in one kind, he might alſo be received at the end of the terme, as a member of the Kingdome. There could be no longer time of ſtay granted to any that did otherwiſe. For this was the unchangeable will of his Imperiall Majeſty. Theſe were given from the Commiſſion of reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at</hi> Prague, N. N. N <hi>&amp;c.

               <p n="14">14. The Emperour in the mean time, that he might preſerve his Kingdome in a flouriſhing condition, or elſe increaſe his glory, fill'd the empty places of thoſe that departed with ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall perſons: to whom (being advanced to the dignity of State) he aſſign'd the firſt place, and

               <p n="2">2. To ſuch as theſe, were all buſineſſes in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties committed, upon their determination the <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-Councells</hi>
                  <pb n="267" facs="tcp:169711:139"/> were commanded to depend.

               <p>SHortly after the taking of <hi>Prague,</hi> the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Citizens</hi> were cited by the <hi>Kings Judges,</hi> and examined upon oath, to declare if any of them knew that the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> had ſtubbornely ſpoke or done any thing; which, as every one anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for truth or affection-ſake, were received as Oracles, and afterwards became the cauſe of death to many, even alltogether innocent.</p>
               <p n="2">2. An <hi>Act or Decree</hi> was publiſhed unto the reſt of the Citizens (who thought themſelves received into favour) in the year 1624. <hi>Febr.</hi> 23. That they had forfeited their Eſtates by their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion;</hi> nevertheleſſe <hi>Caeſar</hi> deſired not that they ſhould be altogether <hi>ſequeſtred,</hi> but that every one ſhould <hi>contribute</hi> part of his fortunes to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the warres. And here an exact eſtimate of their poſſeſſions was required of every one of them upon oath: And according to this confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (or alſo by a ſuſpition or gueſs which they had, from their ready money) a <hi>ranſome</hi> of <hi>favour</hi> was impoſed upon each of them, (for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining

               <p n="3">3. Afterwards all <hi>Non-Catholiques</hi> were (<hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril</hi> 15.) forbid to be enrolled in the <hi>City-Catalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue:</hi> As for thoſe which were inſcribed ſince the yeare 1618. all trading and negotiation was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited them.

               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Shortly after (to wit, <hi>May</hi> 29.) Letters were hung upon the doores of the <hi>Common Halls</hi> in all Cities, the tenour whereof was thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The moſt illuſtrious Prince, Lord Charles of Lichtenſtein,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>hath underſtood by credible per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that certain of the late exiled Preachers, do not onely lurk privily in the Cities belonging to the people of</hi> Prague, <hi>but alſo exerciſe divine ſervice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Houſes, Gardens and Vineyards, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by do draw away the People from their lawful obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience unto the Magiſtrate. Which thing, ſince it can be no way agreeable to his illuſtrious Highneſſe for the dangerous example of Rebellion lately raiſed; he therefore ſtrictly chargeth the Judges of his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Majeſty, that they be moſt diligently watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and whenſoever they find any Conventicles,</hi>
                  <pb n="273" facs="tcp:169711:142"/> ſtraightwaies taking with them publicke officers to breake into thoſe houſes (without reſpect of perſons,) and having apprehended the perſons to arreſt them; whether Predicants, Readers or Singers. Hee hath alſo underſtood that Piccardy Songs and Rimes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed under the name of Pſalmes are ſung up and down, not onely privatly, but even publickly in Villages and ſtreets: They are therefore diligently to obſerve that it be amended, and that nothing but what is allowed by the Catholicke church, bee ſaid or ſung by any man. And as great circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection is to be uſed, that all Schoole-maſters not Catholick, be expelled out of the houſes in all Cities and if they ſhall be taught for the future, that they be hailed to priſon and puniſhment, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Another Edict ſucceeded, Sept. 13. yet ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more moderate, whereby the Kings benevolence and all their priviledges were declared to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed unto the people of Prague after payment of the Tax: with both of which notwithſtanding they rejoiced not long, for (that I ſpeake not of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall vexations for Religion ſake) there iſſued forth in the year following, from the Officers of the Kingdom, unto the Counſells at Prague this ſame Decree. [The ſupreame Officers and Judges of the Kingdome, in the name and place of his Sacred Majeſty, doe command by their Commiſſioners cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen for this purpoſe, the Conſul and Senate of Prague
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:169711:143"/> the leſſe, and alſo of old and new &amp;c. that they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly inſtruct all Non-catholick Citizens, called into the Court, of the finall will and pleaſure of the Kings Majeſty, which is no other, than that all men renouncing their hereſie, doe betake themſelves unto the Church.

De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed in the Chancellors Court in Bohemia, in the yeare 1626. Feb. 13.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In the yeare beginning 1627. There were ſupream Commiſſaries for Religion choſen by the Emperour: whoſe names wee have before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited. Theſe therefore entring upon their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from thoſe at Prague, do ſend a decree to the Chieftaines of the Cities of Prague: wherein after a large commendation of the Kings fatherly care for the good of his ſubjects, as alſo of the Learning, God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, zeale, and watchfulneſſe, of the Spirituall Paſtors (whereof there was ſuch abundance at Prague, and throughout the whole Kingdome: and laſtly of his wonderfull clemency, and forbearance heretofore uſed toward hereticks: and on the contrary lamenting the hereticks great obſtinacy: do now ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly proteſt to act for the Kings ſacred Majeſty and for him onely. They do therefore command, that each of them do cauſe the citizens in the Cities commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:169711:143"/> to them, to be catalogued, and carefully ſent unto them, and diſtributed into four rancks. In the firſt order the native Catholicks are to be inſcribed, in the ſecond, thoſe that were lately converted: in the third thoſe that have given good hopes of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and in the laſt the obſtinate, &amp;c. Given as above ſaid.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Theſe chief Officers give the commands unto the Kings Judges: they to the Tribuns of the people and Senators, and theſe walking from doore to doore, examin the father and mother of the family, the man and maide-ſervants, and all other the Inhabitants in every houſe, and aske them in what order they would be placed, and ſo did accordingly. Theſe Catalogues thus made, are brought to the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries: who when they find but few of the firſt, ſecond, or third Order, they conſult with great anxiety what is neceſſary to be done to ſuch a troupe of Heretickes, that all tumults may be prevented. At length they conclude that the heads ſhould bee removed, viz. That thoſe men which were of any rule and authority with the people ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The beginning was effected upon four vener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, grave Citizens of Old Prague, the thundering <hi>Edict</hi> againſt them (ommitting Court complements) runs thus</p>

But leſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſhould do the like, both the fury of the Kings Officers in the Cities, and the inſolency of the Monks and ſouldiers appointed to keep ward, did greatly withſtand them; for thoſe miſerable men when almoſt all (for feare of thoſe harpies) fled from their houſes, they were plundered moſt rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſly, and permitted to carry nothing away of their goods and houſhold ſtuffe, but what they remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved away privily.

So ſoone as it began to be moleſted by the mony-maſter <hi>(Wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſowecius)</hi> under the pretence of Religion; the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of the Kings Revenue began alſo to be dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; their Mettall-Artiſts (moſt of them being Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans) failing them in moſt places.

               <p n="2">2, In the year therefore 1626 a Garriſon of three bands being brought in, force began to be uſed, and firſt of all in February certain of the Citizens were baniſhed, others caſt into priſon, upon the 20. of March <hi>Adam Trubacz, Iohn Bukac, Peter Stehlik,</hi> were ſequeſtred, to ſtrike a terrour into the reſt. Having given them into their hands certaine ſquare ſtaffs, two Cubits long, in which each of their crimes were ingraven, the firſt thus: Adam Trubacz, <hi>is therefore ſequeſtred, becauſe he ſaid, that there was none ſo powerfull who ſhould command his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, alſo that he would not give his ſoul to the

               <p n="3">3. After the ejection of theſe men, when the reſt did not (as yet) ſeeme to repent of what they have done, they are again warned into the Court, and ſhut up into ſeverall Rooms, and thence called out one by one, and examined ſingly. Amongſt the firſt was <hi>Daniel Miconius</hi> Towne-Clarke, upon whoſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance, they hyred a certaine Rogue to ſtand in a corner, with a weapon in his hand: whom ſo ſoone as this fearefull man law, from his too greedy deſire of life, promiſed to turne Catholick. They being glad at ſo happy a beginning, commanded the reſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne and goe home, and exhort them to doe the like, but he going to his friends; being amazed, tells them
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:169711:149"/> of the Rogue before mentioned: and that they were in danger, beſeeching his friends that they would bee circumſpect, and have a regard of themſelves. There was in the company of theſe men that were warned to appeare, two Burgo-maſters, learned men and Mrs. of Arts, by name <hi>George Kezelius,</hi> and <hi>Henry Daniel,</hi> of Semania, Upon whom ſeeing the reſt depend, they did incourage both themſelves and others exceedingly, and did exhort them that they ſhould not at all value thoſe imaginary terrors. By and by <hi>Kezelius</hi> is called out, and what with ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry flatteries, and what with threatnings, he is wearied ſo long, till at laſt unawares he deſires time to conſider. They being contented with this demaund, commands <hi>Semaninus</hi> to be ſent for, who being certified concerning the wavering of <hi>Kezelius,</hi> began the more to bee reſolved: and when an old man, one George <hi>Dernikarz,</hi> propounded him as an example for his imitation, he ſpit in the old mans face, ſaying, Traitor: is this your conſtancy. Alſo he goes on, and preſents himſelf to the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers unmoveable as a rock, as alſo all the reſt that followed, at length <hi>Kezel us,</hi> conſidering that his failing was greater in Gods ſight than poſſible it could be in mans, repenting himſelf, and with a very poſitive anſwer tooke away all that hope which they conceived of him, and with the reſt is ſent to priſon.</p>

This law was ratified and obſerved inviolable for a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares, untill the time of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> for in the yeare 1617. two Ieſuiticall brats were ſuborned (to wit) <hi>Nicolas Marazek,</hi> and <hi>Bartholomew Collins,</hi> who threatening their houſes, demanded to be made free-men of the City, which being denyed, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered their complaint in the Chancery of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, whither were warned three of the principall Senators, with the Town-clarke, who were enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with rough words by the Chancelor and <hi>Paul Micna</hi> the Secretary, and were kept in the town of Prague for nine daies, till they ſhould agree; ſo
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:169711:154"/> what was the effect of this? After five moneths ſpace the forenamed <hi>Marazek</hi> is choſen the Senator, that ſo by this meanes they might have their Spyes in all places. But he whileſt the States were in armes to oppoſe the enemy of the Proteſtant Religion, namely the Kings Vice-roy, was forced whether he would or no to be quiet; till at length by the Emperours victory he incouraged himſelf and was made Judge for the Emperour at <hi>Litomeric,</hi> who proceeded to trouble and diſturb the town as much as he could, but they indured all things patiently in reſpect of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cities; for they never went to the popiſh Church although they were deprived of their own Miniſters, neither did any of them ſuffer himſelf to be inticed into apoſtacy, although two ſubtil deceivers <hi>Valerius Magnus</hi> and <hi>Franciſcus Rozdazovius,</hi> did ſtrongly indeavour it, often times diſcourſing with certaine of the chief Citizens.</p>

<pb n="295" facs="tcp:169711:154"/> otherwiſe they ſhould forfeit five pounds every time, but the buſineſſe did not proceed according to their deſire neither.</p>
               <p n="3">3. At laſt therefore they bring in more ſouldiers, and begin to act more furiouſly upon <hi>Corpus Chriſti</hi> day, (as they call it) they command all the people to be preſent at their Idolatrous proceſſions, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Paul Stranſki,</hi> Recorder of the Town would not be at this foppery, nor appear, they ſend a whole band of ſouldiers (hee hiding himſelfe in his houſe) they plunder him, and abuſe, and threaten his wife <hi>Katherin,</hi> whom they found ſitting by the fire. Mr. <hi>George Colſſin,</hi> ſon in law to a principle man in the City, is carried before the Councell of War, and is accuſed of Treaſon againſt the Catholicks, that hee did indeavour to ſhut up the Queriſter in the Church, for which thing <hi>Hiparchus Loreulius Medicius,</hi> an Italian, threatned he ſhould die, but in the interim hee commands him to bee kept in the court, but becauſe this was a ſcandalous fiction, with which <hi>Colſinus</hi> was abuſed, as alſo their other plots in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended againſt the reſt, no way reſtraining the fury of the enemy, til theſe threatnings vaniſhed into ſmoak, the ſouldiery being preſently commanded away into Germany againſt the Dane.</p>

<pb n="297" facs="tcp:169711:155"/> playing, he was an inſatiable devourer of wine, and a great gameſter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When in whole foure yeares time, hee ſaw no one to be converted by this way; he put on a ſevere Countenance. Hee did deſire that the Croati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Souldier being then there, would be a helpe unto him, and therefore, gathering the Aſſembly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether on a Holy-day, he doth explaine the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of the Maſſe, and doth invite and exhort them from the Sermon to performe the Proceſſion; having privatly ſuborned ſome of his Army (Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legues) who might promote the buſines: when then that no man would follow him (going before with the Hoſte) the Croations ruſh into the Temple and with drawn ſwords compel them to follow; the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple being affrighted, and fearing ſlaughter, run as if they were diſtracted, but are repulſed by ſome troups of his men placed in the Market-place; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſome, whether they would or no, were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to goe that way: others, notwithſtanding, eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped: but the thing was a matter of ſlaughter to both.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In the yeare 1626. The Commiſſioners of Reformation ſend the whole Brenavian Regiment hither, with an expreſſe command not to depart un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the City were reformed. The Arch-Deacon thinking to take the chief men, firſt he goes to ſome of them, bringing along with him Captaine <hi>Stranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> and firſt he did imperiouſly inquire of <hi>Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:169711:156"/> Acontius,</hi> a Phiſitian dwelling hard by him (being for ſome years lame by reaſon of the paines of the Gout) whether at length he would become a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke. Hee replied, as long as I feele no other notions in my heart, I can doe nothing againſt my conſcience: But the Arch-Deacon being very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry ſaid; Your ſawcineſſe hath been ſufficiently tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated, there is now no place left for any ſophiſtica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Phiſitian replied, <hi>Credit, Eye,</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> will not indure to be mocked. The Arch-Deacon Replied; As longe as three or foure heads are not cut off, this City will never be reduced to a better ſtate. The Phiſitian againe anſwered. If that you thinke that my head hinders you, you have power over it, and command it to be cut off; I would rather that this halfe-rotten Carkeſs ſhould bee dragged through the fields, and torne by piece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meal, than to doe any thing willingly and knowingly againſt my conſcience. The Arch-Deacon ariſeth and flings out of doores. The Captaine following him, ſpake with a low voice to the Phiſitian, Sir you ſhall not want counſell, the world is large and wide enough.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Preſently the whole Community of the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens are aſſembled together, with the inhabitants of the Suburbs, and the Gates being ſhut, they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out one after another: and ſtruck with grievous threatenings, the fearefuller promiſe obedience, thoſe
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:169711:156"/> which deny, are thruſt into priſons: all the corners Sellers, and Roomes of the court are filled with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted perſons.

So one way and one fear drove theſe miſerable wretches into the Nets of Antichriſt which had been ſo long avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded becauſe they did not remember that they muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt to the ſhedding of their bloud, and not only to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment.</p>

For example ſake at Bidſove, a Towne ſtanding three miles from Hradecium and ten from Prague. When he arrived here with his ſouldiers, and calling the citizens into the Court, hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Catholick Religion with an oration full of words; and <hi>John Kolacznik,</hi> whom they had choſen for themſelves, anſwering, in the name of the corporation, that it was not in the power of man that one ſhould unlearn that in the ſpace of an hour, which he had been learning all his life, neither was it convenient, that any man ſhould forſake that which hee had imbraced for the truth of God, unleſſe hee were taught better things out of the word of God.

<pb n="302" facs="tcp:169711:158"/> to come, and to carry him out of the City: (which among us is a note of the greateſt diſgrace) not ſo much as grantng him time to viſit his houſe. The reſt being terrified with this example, and fearing the fury of the inraged, did ſubmit themſelves unto his will and promiſed to be taught within a cettain time.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And when that ſome thought to have ſaved their conſciences by flight, they ſent their wives before privately with their goods (with whom ſome Godly widows joyned themſelves) the things being betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they had thoſe things taken away from them by ſouldiers ſent for that purpoſe, and they were brought back and put in fetters, and were not diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed till they became catholicks with their husbands.</p>

This ſong was brought to him, and by way of ſcoffe, ſung to the Citizens that came unto him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The 20. of <hi>December</hi> he calles the Citizen to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and with indignation does upbraide them for their late Rebellion, as alſo <hi>Mansfield</hi> and <hi>Seska,</hi> and a certain Citizen named <hi>John Rokiſzan</hi> (he that was before choſen Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Prague,</hi> a man as they ſay alltogether uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant) and forthwith compelled them to write
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:169711:162"/> their names in three Regiſter-books. In the firſt, the names of thoſe which were already Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, (there were ſix Apoſtates lately made.) In the ſecond, the names of thoſe that would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Apoſtates in two weeks. In the third, the names of thoſe which were refractory and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to God and <hi>Caeſar;</hi> but when he ſaw that thoſe of the third ſort were far more in number then the other, he began to devote them to all cruelties, pronouncing them worthy of the Croſſe, the wheele, yea of hell it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The day following being <hi>Thomas</hi> day, he compells all to appear in the Temple, and he, as an example to the reſt going before them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the Sacrament under one kind after dinner, again he commands that notice ſhould be given by the Bells, and entring the Temple when he ſaw no body preſent (for even the <hi>Monkes</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were not as yet come) he runnes out, and going through the Market, the ſtreetes, yea into the very houſes, drives all that he meetes with his ſtick to the Temple, being entred again, and there ſeeing M. <hi>John Felixteſſius</hi> a chief Citizen, and moſt odious unto him, becauſe a Calvineſt ſets upon him, beating him with his knobby Club (which he had taken from a certain Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-man ſtanding by) and followes him even to the Altar, ſaying, <hi>Thou wicked fellow who haſt ſet
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:169711:162"/> thy name in the Regiſter-book of the damned, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeſt to confeſſe.</hi> He thereupon deſires the Earle, that he would conſider the holineſſe of the place, and he would deal more mildly with him, but the Earle beats him ſtill more and more about the head, ſhoulders, and hands: <hi>Felix</hi> thereupon bending his knees, deſired help of God; but the Tyrant ſeeing his blood in a great meaſure flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, at laſt ſayes thus to him, <hi>Get thee hence O thou beaſt with thy curſed Calvin-blood;</hi> he riſing up, goes out of the Temple, and ſeverall asking what had happened, anſwers them thus, <hi>My blood hath dropt from me, between the Temple and the Altar, but it was for his name who did abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly powre out his blood for us.</hi>

               <p n="4">4. He being gone out of the Temple, the Earl compelling the Citizens that were gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to confeſſe, did furiouſly rage againſt them, belching out his curſes againſt all, but beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome with his ſtaffe, and ſpitting in the faces of others, but his cruelty did moſt appear in pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the grave beard of that moſt honeſt Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen <hi>Wenceſlaus Croſinus,</hi> and ſtrowing it about the Temple.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Being returned home, he Commands that <hi>Felix</hi> ſhould be again called, and threatens that he would act another Trajedy with him, unleſſe he did diſcover himſelf to be of another mind, on
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:169711:163"/> the day following, but he thinking that the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row was not to be expected (ſaying that nothing was done by reaſon, but all by ſplene and fury) withdrew himſelf by night, leaving behind him his Mother of foure ſcore years of age, his wife and moſt dear Children.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The Earl ſeeing his hopes and expectation failed him, commands his goods to be confiſcated, his wife to be impriſoned, and thoſe that he had before forced to an Apoſtaſie: he now compells to ſubſcribe to a certain paper wherein the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of <hi>Rokizan</hi> did teſtifie, that they did owe their ſafety to God, to the Virgin Mary, to the Lord <hi>Deacon</hi> of <hi>Collerate,</hi> and that they did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Catholique Religion freely, and with all readineſſe of mind, onely the cowle being the occaſion of it, and this they did teſtifie by the ſubſcription of their hands, and the Seale of the City, and ſo that miſerable Earle being ſo <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">

               <p n="2">2. But <hi>John Jahoda</hi> was fined a ſumme of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. For when he would not be preſent at an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous proceſſion, neither would erect an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar before his houſe, he being called into the Court, was accuſed of blaſphemy againſt God, and Rebellion againſt the Magiſtrate. The pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment pronounced to him was impriſonment for 9. weeks, and the payment of 50. dollars (to help to get a new hoaſt) when the time of his impriſonment was run out, he laid down his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, proteſting, <hi>That he gave nothing to the Hoaſt (for he knew no other to waſh away the ſinnes of the world, then that which was lifted up on the Croſſe) but in obedience to the Magiſtrate, who might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert this money to what uſe he pleaſed.</hi> For which words being ſent back to priſon, he was not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed till after a moneth, and with the payment of 50. ſhillings: But inſtantly driven out of the City with his wife. He was a very zealous man, who a little after dying of the plague at <hi>Prague,</hi> he piouſly ſlept.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>John Bleyſſa</hi> when he had again offended, (having offered his Daughter privately to a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Miniſter to be baptized) was firſt put into a ſtinking priſon, and after (with his wife lately delivered) puniſhed with baniſhment: The third
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:169711:164"/> part of his goods was onely granted unto him, the other two parts being brought into the Lords Coffer: But when he ſaw this taken away, and getting nothing of the whole, he committed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to divine providence with a full confidence, and indured the miſeries of baniſhment, even to death, dying at <hi>Pern</hi> in <hi>Miſnia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. In the year 1626. The ſame Captain, that he might bring a univerſall deluge of Apoſtaſie, brought in Souldiers, and compelled ſome by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers tortures to a deſperate obedience. Among the reſt, he forced 50. men into a narrow place of the Court, where they could not ſtand, much leſſe ſit, or lie. While they were kept in this place three whole dayes, and there having all paſſage out denied them, they performed the work of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (Sr. Reverence) it could not be, but that they, being troubled with the ſtink, and likewiſe ſad and angry, ſhould faint.

For when the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens with a ſmall force couragiouſly reſiſted for three dayes the Imperiall Army paſſing that way, then being about to yield themſelves, they came down from the walls and forts, and prepared to carry out the keys, the enemy furiouſly aſſaulting the gate, broke it open, and firſt kil'd the Maior of the City, bringing the keyes, and then other men whom they met, and the youth; that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in three houres one thouſand ſix hundred and ſixty Citizens were ſlain; ſcarce ten, whom flight or ſome deeper lurking place had ſaved from their fury.

In the year 1625. it was promiſed them by the Commiſſioners of reformation, that if they would become Catholicks, their Liberty, Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, and Towns, with the Villages, ſhould be reſtored. They refuſing, were prohibited from their works and trades: and ſo put the diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent perſons, men, women, ſonnes and daughters, in divers priſons, and miſerably afflicted them four whole moneths. At length being made Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, nothing was reſtored to them, that there might not want a teſtimony that theſe bloudy promiſers were his progeny, who promiſeth all things, and performeth nothing.</p>

<pb n="319" facs="tcp:169711:166"/> of affaires, and the whole bleſſing of God, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing alſo their great hope of the kindneſſe of the Emperour, and their Lords, and the dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing of their burdens, and they alſo themſelves being but little liberall in ſuch a grievous dearth of proviſion, did offer either money, or corn, if they would change their religion, by which ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem ſome are deceived; examples of this thing are extant every where, and alſo in <hi>Koſſimberg, Cerket;</hi> where when a <hi>Monk</hi> being more greedy of praiſe for the converſion of <hi>Hereticks,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of meriting heaven did promiſe to every one that confeſſed a buſhell of wheat, the poorer ſort ran to him, bringing their confeſſions to the Prieſt for corn, he being afraid of his Granary, leſt it ſhould faile, if he did ſo largely diſtribute, reſolved to diſpenſe more ſparingly, and gives to one of a mean eſtate that came to him, but halfe the meaſure; but he taking away his ſhare, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns and requires the reſt. The <hi>Monk</hi> denying him, <hi>What,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>is my ſoule more vile then the reſt?</hi> ſo he departed angerly.

But when they ſaw that few were drawn unto them by their fox-like ſubtilty, they return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their wolviſh cruelty, and compelled ſome by force to frequent their Maſſe, and therefore Catalogues are made through all the Churches, and puniſhment to thoſe that were abſent, the Sexton being to give notice.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If any went privately to the Neighbour-Churches of the Proteſtants (while there were ſome yet remaining) or to their private religious Exerciſes, being known they were fined, impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and whipt; ſometimes ſouldiers were ſuborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed who might diſtribute, and ruine the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant meetings, by their invaſion of which thing I will relate one example, when that the year 1623. was brought about, when as much people had met upon the Feaſt of the Nativity of Chriſt, in the Temple near to <hi>Kutiburg,</hi> and the Village <hi>Wyſoke</hi> (in the Oratory of the Barons of <hi>Dona) Beneda</hi> and <hi>Lazgeausky, Bohemian</hi> Noble-men, Collonels of Horſe, remaining in the Gariſon of <hi>Kutiburg,</hi> on a ſudden flie hither with their ſcame, incompaſſe the Temple, ruſh in, and draw from the Altar the Miniſter <hi>George Barthius,</hi> ſtrip off his clothes, and carry him away priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er (but yet he eſcapt) and caſt the holy bread upon the earth, and poure out the wine, and trample upon it. They then take away with them
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:169711:167"/> whatſoever ſtuffe was ordained to holy uſes, they ſtript perſons of both Sexes, ſo that it happened that ſome being utterly naked, running home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in a deep ſnow through many furlongs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vehemently hurt through the ſharpneſſe of the cold, died. Some were wounded, others (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſo many glittering ſwords) fell into diſeaſes by reaſon of fear, what beſides they did with the women-kind in the Temple, modeſty forbids me to ſpeak; the ſpoiles, as if taken from an enemy publickly ſold at <hi>Kutiburg;</hi> and in their feaſts they merrily drunk out of the cup which was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, and all without any puniſhment. I forbear to ſpeak of more of the like caſes.</p>
               <p n="6">6. They afterwards tried to weaken their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages by threatning greater evils. For an example of which, a command was given by the Prince <hi>Lichtenſtein</hi> to the Captain of <hi>Pirglisky</hi> 1624. on the 20th. of <hi>December,</hi> That whoſoever ſhould deny to obey their orders, in forſaking their here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall errours, whether they were men or women, old men or young men, free men or forraigners, in-mates or ſervants, he ſhould ſend them to the Councell of the Kingdom by name, and from thence he ſhould expect inſtructions what to do with their perſons, and their goods.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Afterwards Marriages, Burials, Baptiſme were forbidden to thoſe that were Non-Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:169711:168"/> that which indeed was a thunder-bolt which ſhook the mindes of many, eſpecially thoſe which intended to marry. The want of baptiſme and diſgrace of buriall (becauſe they were to be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by the gardens, fields, and high-wayes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ceremony) could be endured more eaſily: if any one were privately married, or had his infant baptized, his puniſhment was a long im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, unleſſe that he could procure his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty either by apoſtaſie, or by ſome great fine.</p>
               <p n="8">8. In the Towns, both thoſe that belonged to the King, and to the Nobility, workes, and trades, and all means of getting their living were forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, at length buying of food was prohibited, as at <hi>Litomſte,</hi> being oppreſt therefore with want and hunger, there was a neceſſity either to flie (but whether ſo for ever while the ſame face of things did appear) or deſpair or apoſtatize, as moſt of them did.</p>
               <p n="9">9. They did ſet the Countrey-men into the Towns, they took thoſe who denied to come, either by a Troop of Souldiers ſent, or by their Court-flatterers, or elſe they did apprehend them in the night, draw them out of their chambers, and drive them by troops like beaſts, even in the ſharpeſt cold; and filled the common-priſon, the Towers, Sellers, Stables, and Hog-ſties with them, where they were killed with hunger, and
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:169711:168"/> thirſt, and filth, and cold, and heat. <hi>Joachim</hi> a Chyrurgion with others, was caſt into a Tower full of ſnakes at <hi>Plumlone.</hi> At <hi>Proſtanna</hi> were put together into the Caſtle Stable, and the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow every where cloſed up, that being almoſt ſtrangled for want of aire, fainted; among others <hi>James <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>licky</hi> an old man of above 80 yeares of age was drawn out for dead (being an Inhabitant of <hi>Koſteleck,</hi> a little Town of the ſaid <hi>Kelted,</hi> whoſe ſon <hi>Matthew <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>licky,</hi> a Miniſter of the Word, was tormented at <hi>Czaſlavia,</hi> as we have related in the 57. <hi>Chapter</hi>) but <hi>Kunaſh</hi> the chiefe perſecutor often times repeating that they did counterfeit death, ſaid that he would raiſe the knaves, and ſo commanded that good ſtore of water ſhould be poured upon them. Some came to themſelves, but the old man died in his ſight, whom he commanded to be carried out and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, the reſt not being diſmiſt, unleſſe they would promiſe confeſſion. In ſome places they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to that degree of Barbariſme, that they ſhut up men in Privies to be poiſoned by the ſtink of excrements, which <hi>Nicholas Szarowetz,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others had experience at <hi>Koſenburg,</hi> alſo ſome of <hi>Slunen</hi> at <hi>Letomiſle,</hi> and elſe-where, they thruſt men and women together into the ſame place, that there was ſcarce any room for modeſty.</p>

                  <pb n="324" facs="tcp:169711:169"/>10. They invented new priſons to torment more grievouſly, and to ruine more ſpeedily. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample ſake, at <hi>Foleſſovie</hi> in <hi>Moravia, Dracovius</hi> a <hi>Jeſuite,</hi> being preſently reformer upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> for their King, in the yeare 1617. there were holes made, and ſpikes put in them, wherein thoſe that were ſhut, could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lie, ſit, nor ſtand, by reaſon of the narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the place, but bending and crooked, they with their knees halfe bent, and their backs preſt: they hung halfe to the ground. It was ſcarce poſſible that any one ſhould indure this preſſure above two or three houres, their ſinnes in the mean time quivering, their Members trembling, and their hearts ready to faint with trouble and feare. In the mean time ſome came, who asking them whether they would volentarily imbrace the Catholique Religion; moſt ſeeing to be fed with lies did grant it, the ſimpler ſort denyed it, and were brought back to torture, untill they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo did lie, in ſaying, they were made voluntary Catholiques.</p>
               <p n="11">11. The like impriſonment happened to <hi>John Rederius,</hi> a freeborn Subject, and Treaſurer of <hi>Pardubicium,</hi> (an imperial Town) who all the reſt forſaking faith, onely continued conſtant; but when he prepared himſelf for baniſhment, he
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:169711:169"/> was kept in priſon, becauſe there was no body found who might take the charge of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, a delay being alwayes made for ſome fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed reaſon or other, the good man perceiving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf abuſed, and fearing ſome deviliſh ſnares, laid in a certain place with letters of Proteſtations, and thoſe bookes of account, and in the year 1625. betook himſelf into a neighbouring Town called <hi>Brundus,</hi> upon <hi>Orliſen,</hi> a Town of <hi>Charles</hi> Lord of <hi>Zeratin,</hi> where hitherto Religion had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed; but being by craft removed from thence, was caſt into priſon, and not ſuffered to depart, before he changes Religion, although he did pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently indure his impriſonment for three whole yeares, and often deſired to be baniſhed, yet his adverſaries more and more by degrees endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſhake his conſtancy; at length they devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a priſon upon the water, very narrow, and not above a Cubit and a halfe in length, that ſo when he lay down, he could by no meanes lay himſelf at length, and they had provided ſo, that if he ſhould turn himſelf unawares, he muſt then fall into the water underneath, and be dipt: now it was winter-time, and he himſelf was ſick of the Gout, and no body was admitted to come to him, except ſome inſtruments of the Devill, who ſhould tempt him to turne, he being
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:169711:170"/> tormented with this kind of puniſhment for three dayes and nights, at length begun to faint, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when his wife came to him, who was newly turned a Papiſt, and oppreſt him with her cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, therefore halfe doubting, he conſented, and was carried into a Monaſtery, and was recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Guarden into the number of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks.</p>
               <p n="12">12. If Commiſſioners were ſent any where, that the buſineſſe might not be delayed, they took this policy in hand, that they ſhould firſt aſſault the men of greateſt authority, either by cunning, or force, and make them an example to the reſt, in the Town <hi>Minion,</hi> when Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>Zenkow de Kolowrat</hi> demanded a poſitie an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Subjects of that Countrey, convened together, whether they would be Catholicks or no; and one of them, in the name of the reſt, began to ſpeak boldly concerning Religion, <hi>That conſcience would nor could not be forced,</hi> he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently commanded him to he apprehended, and in the ſight of them all to be laid upon the ground, and beat, withall asking whether he would be a Catholick, but he continually deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yea when he could hardly ſpeak, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary commanded him to be torn in pieces; when he was halfe dead, the reſt were affrighted at the dreadfulneſſe of this ſpectacle, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:169711:170"/> obedience, if time would permit them. When the Senatours of <hi>Fermanno Meſtecia,</hi> a Town hard by <hi>Chruda,</hi> refuſed to be made examples to others of apoſtaſie, they were thrown in a ſcurvy priſon, the preſident of them being forced to ride the wooden horſe in the Market-place (uſed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly to puniſh mutinous ſouldiers) although he was very ancient, yet indured this ignominie, and contempt, and pain, for above ſix hours, but at evening after the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> had continually ſolicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with their ſuggeſtions, and his wife and children with their lamentation, he yielded, and was taken off the wooden-horſe halfe dead for he could neither go, nor make uſe of any member, &amp; ſo he was carried by other men to a Confeſſor.</p>
               <p n="13">13. When ſome deſired rather to die, then to be forced to Apoſtaſie, it was anſwered, <hi>That the Emperour did not thirſt after their blood, but onely the welfare of their ſoule;</hi> ſome others put queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and they were thus anſwered in a ſcoffing manner, <hi>O you affect the glory of Martyrdome, but ye are baſe knaves, and are unworthy to have any thing to glory in:</hi> this Anſwer had <hi>John Polacicus</hi> of (<hi>Franiſium</hi> in <hi>Moravia</hi>) who being ſolicited by the Souldiers and <hi>Jeſuites</hi> ſeverally to Apoſtaſie, he fell down upon his knees, &amp; held up his hands, and intreated, <hi>That they would cut off his head, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then force his Conſcience:</hi> And this Anſwer
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:169711:171"/> had <hi>John Elius</hi> of <hi>Stubnecimus,</hi> and others in other places, and this was the true cauſe why in all theſe daily perſecutions of <hi>Ferdinand, Bohemia</hi> as alſo all <hi>Germany</hi> did not produce more Martyrs, there were not wanting who would have died in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the Chriſtian faith; but there were none who would inflict death upon bare account, for it was determined by theſe cruel Tyrants, brought up in the Devills Schoole, not to kill the body but the ſoule, and therefore they had rather by lingring and continued puniſhments, render men unſtable and wavering in the truth, then by their patiently maintaining the faith, make them victorious, they onely put them to death, upon whom they had any colour of a civil crime, as is manifeſt in theſe Martyrs of <hi>Prague. Andreas Chebdovius,</hi> a ſweet and hopefull young man, was thus dealt with, whom they apprehended at <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſta,</hi> as he was in his journey from <hi>Podebradium</hi> his native Countrey, going to the Court of <hi>Inowen,</hi> into his ſervice he had ingaged himſelf at <hi>Fara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſium,</hi> they faſtened him to a ſharpe ſtake, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was a Meſſenger, to carry about ſeverall treaſonable deſignes, when nevertheleſſe they found nothing about him, but a few Letters writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten from friends to friends, nor by any tortures could they force him to confeſſe any thing, and this was done in the year 1622.</p>

                  <pb n="329" facs="tcp:169711:171"/>14. They likewiſe took another courſe which was both tyrannical over the Conſciences of men, and diſhonourable to God, that becauſe they ſee they could neither convince nor convert any one by the word of God: therefore they reſolved with themſelves, to make no uſe of any argument from Scripture; eſpecially to the vulgar multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, but by Authority of their Church, and by force compell'd them to obedience; wherefore if any man did appeal unto the Scriptures, they were anſwered with ſcoffes and jeeres, and taunts, they accuſed the Scripture of imperfection, of obſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, of ambiguity, that it was the fountain of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, the ſanctuary of Hereticks, and that Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men had nothing to do with it: this was nothing with them, nay, theſe blaſphemous wretches were not afraid with their foule mouthes to nick-name the Bible <hi>Wiblia,</hi> that is in our Language <hi>vomit,</hi> and ſo they ſpit in the very face of God himſelf, wherefore they took away all religious bookes, from the people, that ſo the blind leading the blind, they might over-ſpread the Kingdom with darknes; &amp; alſo they perceived that the people by this meanes being deprived of all light from the word of God, might more eaſily be overſpread with the darkneſſe of error.</p>
               <p n="15">15. Some of the Nobles after they had forced their Tenants into their Church, and ſhut the
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:169711:172"/> doores, compell them to receive the Euchariſt in one kind, as <hi>Severinus Talho</hi> in the village of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dercze,</hi> in the County of <hi>Pilſnen,</hi> in the year 1628. with his ſword drawn, went about in the Church, and ſolicited thoſe that refuſed to fall down and worſhip <hi>John Adams, Czeyka</hi> in <hi>Newcitz,</hi> a Town of the ſame County, did beat the joynts of their leggs with Clubs, and ſo forced them to fall down, which was alſo done by <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Klenow,</hi> Lord of <hi>Rupovia, John Stepkenick</hi> being ſent for by his Lord <hi>George Metrowsky</hi> at <hi>Mautina,</hi> when he perceived that he was to be fettered and chained, leapt through the window into the trench of the Caſtle, indeavouring to ſcape Apoſtaſie by his flight; but he being purſued by the Guard, was brought back again wounded, and was therefore ſent to priſon at <hi>Pilſna,</hi> not to be releaſed before he had abjured his Religion, the ſame <hi>Metrowksy</hi> kept another man of his own (<hi>Ambroſe Sterpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus</hi> a skinner by trade) in priſon a whole yeare, becauſe he continued firm in his Religion, and thrice he ſent the Hangman to him, and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to be racked, and by the torments of his rack forced him to confeſſion: at length he was let go, and was fined 100. Imperials: the Townſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of <hi>Kneſoveſia</hi> upon <hi>Slana</hi> purſued with drawn Swords, the poor Countrey people that fled into the fields, and brought them back again, ſome of

               <p>At <hi>Ronspurg</hi> in <hi>Toſta,</hi> and in certain other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, theſe wicked reformers are reported to have gone ſo farre in their wickedneſſe, as to force ſome of the people not only meerly to abjure the Cup, but alſo to throwe it upon the ground, and ſpit upon it, and tread it under their feete; and this was the uſuall forme of abjuring the Cup, and ſwearing to the Catholique Religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ſweare before God Almighty and the Virgin Mary, and all the Saints, that I am not forced, but do voluntarily return to the holy Roman Catholique faith; and I do profeſſe, that it alone is true, ancient, ſaving faith: I do abjure the Cup, neither will I partake of the Cup for ever. Yea moreover, I will by all poſſible meanes diſwade my Children, and thoſe that are committed to my truſt, from partaking of the Cup: I do alſo promiſe, that</hi> I <hi>will conſtantly perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in this Religion, and that I will oppoſe men of

It is not alike provided, how thoſe that were now made Catholiques, ſhould for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture behave themſelves, ſome being content that they had not once filled their luſts upon theſe he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riticall Subjects, let them alone and moleſted them no more, yet theſe poor miſerable Creatures, when ever they had opportunity to ſee an Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall Miniſter did bewaile their Apoſtaſie, and did again communicate in both kindes; but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were a ſecond time compelled, eſpecially, when it was ſuſpected that they did not in their hearts return to the Popiſh Church, concerning which certain Edicts of the Emperour, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners came forth to compell them again and again: a certain Butcher at <hi>Colone</hi> upon the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Elve,</hi> they forced and compelled to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate in one kind, his ſtomack began to riſe, and he went from the Altar and vomitted all the way home; when this was told the Captain, he chect him, but yet let him alone, becauſe he thought it ſufficient that he did obey them.</p>
               <p n="18">18. If any through fear of thoſe tyrannicall proceedings betooke themſelves to flight, their ſafety was not, neither indeed could it be long-lived; for hunger drave thoſe out who had hid themſelves in woods and ſecret places of moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines &amp; as for thoſe that fled for refuge to neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring

               <p n="1">I. THis appendix of the former chapter (ſhewing how the perſecutors dealt with the common people) will be a Hiſtory famous to poſterity. In the year 1629. the fifth day of May, two and twenty country men were brought captives from the village of Zlonice into the City of Slana ſinging with a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant voyce, and triumphant hymnes about the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Chriſt; it was brought in as a matter of charge againſt them, that having before turned Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, they returned to Hereſie, and miniſtred to themſelves holy things. Being ſent into ſeveral priſons, they were forthwith brought to examination: the Chieftain of theſe was ſaid to be one <hi>George Baltha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi> an inhabitant in the village of Tmanus, who had no learning, and yet was a preacher among them: his Maſter therefore <hi>Bohuchwal Walkaun</hi> having a little before turned Apoſtate (leaſt that he ſhould draw up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf <hi>Caeſars</hi> anger, or evill ſurmizes, accuſeth him in a letter written to the Senate of Slana, and therein requires that juſtice ſhould be done upon ſuch a Rebellious fellow. The Senate having ſummoned this man to appear, cauſeth this writing to be read by the Solicitor, and asked what he would give in by
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:169711:177"/> way of anſwer. He requires time, and promiſeth that he would anſwer the writing; leave being given him, he frames this anſwer, which out of the Bohemian tongue we have thus tranſlated word for word.</p>
               <p>I Have underſtood what charge was drawne up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me by <hi>Iames Swojanovius,</hi> under the name of Mr. <hi>Bohuchwal Walkaun.</hi> The firſt article is, That I have been pernicious to God my Creator, and to men in obligation, in that having turned Catholick, I have again fallen from the Roman Catholick faith, and have violated my Oath. To this I anſwer, That hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being in a cruell priſon, I was prevailed upon to ſinne againſt God, my moſt righteous Judge, becauſe then I was weak in the faith, not truſting God, that he was able to deliver his out of the hands of men: but God chaſtiſed me for this my fault, holding my conſcience captive for a whole year together, ſo that I could have no hope in Gods mercy: and yet I recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to mind former ſinners, who did upon their repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance obtain mercy at the hands of God. Thereupon I cryed to my God, a whole year, night and day I did water my bed with my teares, becauſe I thought my ſelfe damned: but that true and righteous God who is not the cauſe of our deſtruction, neither would that a ſinner ſhould die, but rather that hee ſhould be converted and live, when he ſaw a fit time, did not hide his mercies from me; for I obtained what I did
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:169711:178"/> deſire, hee ſent his Angell unto mee, and mine eies ſaw his glory brighter than the ſun, and there was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to me in a moment the holy ſpirit, and I was born again: there was likewiſe afforded me a diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Spirits, ſo that I could diſtinguiſh between good and evill; and with this great gift, I did likewiſe receive a command of reproving the ſinnes of men. Nor am I deceived, for the Spirit of God doth not hide himſelf from any man to whom he is given, that he ſhould not declare to the wicked, things future, but mercy to the penitents: and therefore I was likewiſe forbid by the ſpirit to doe any more the workes of the fleſh, according to the luſts of the world, which had conſpired together, what they might, againſt the juſt Judge of the living and the dead, and againſt the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointed ones whom he hath choſen to himſelfe. Nor is my Mr. <hi>Walkaun</hi> ignorant of this; for they did hinder me from ſpeaking the truth for the ſpace of four years: but by how much the more they hindred me, ſo much the more did God confirme mee by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Likewiſe they may remember, that I came to the Pallace of Zlonice, that I might declare unto them the truth, and invite them to repentance, even as the Lord Jeſus had commanded me by his holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and ſo to continue for three days together, Friday. Sabbath day, and Munday; upon which laſt day, I had alſo my booke with me, (but where he ſaith, I am a ſeducer of ſoules, I anſwer and affirme, that it is
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:169711:178"/> the certain will of the Lord, that all you alſo ſhould hear me) neither were they ſo ſtrong as to ſnatch the book out of my hand. Nevertheleſſe they did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the glory of God: for I ought to teach all, how they might come to repentance, but they had a ſigne given them, when thoſe three ſpiritual men went from me, asking me a ſign from Heaven (but they are without excuſe, for they themſelves held the books in their own hands) and I wept greatly, becauſe they did not receive the Lords Anointed: which indeed is no matter of wonder, ſeeing even from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world, they did perſecute thoſe, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing renewed of God, doe good workes. And it was neceſſary that it ſhould ſo happen to me, that every one might know the world to be an hater of the truth; becauſe the truth is not in it: and that it alſo might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that the world is an enemy of God. Nothing therefore could ſo farre affright me, nor had I reſpect to any thing that ſhould hinder me from the chearfull doing of that work which God had vouchſafed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver unto me. I would therefore know of you, who are made of earth, and of a lump of clay as well as I, what place you will ſhew me, that I might freely teach you without impediment: if that you do refuſe this, there will a time come, wherein you would deſire to ſhew me a place, but ye ſhal not have it. Wherefore in the name of God I do exhort you, that you would not receive this grace of God in vaine, nor deſpiſe it;
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:169711:179"/> for Gods rod is already tooke up, with which God will ſhortly laſh thoſe that do not acknowledge his voyce. There are more things for me to write unto you, but ſeeing my ſelfe knowes not how to write, I muſt have reſpect unto others whom I doe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy, and ſo briefly do conclude. When I ſhall ſpeak with you face to face, I ſhall diſtinctly unfold all things: in the mean while the grace of our Lord God be with us all. <hi>Amen.</hi>

This Epiſtle being read, and they looking upon it as being of an unuſual Stile, there went to him (but acceſſe was denyed to all others) the Paſtor of the place, and ſtrange Jeſuites, conferring with him face to face, and endeavoured to diſſwade him from his purpoſe: but he remitting any thing of his conſtancy, did confeſſe, that he was indeed a Lay man, and had no learning: but yet whatſoever hee did preach, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſhould preach, hee had it not from himſelfe, but from the Holy Spirit. For ſo it is, ſaid he, as late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I haue written, and often I have ſaid, that I (after that my abominable fall) did ſpeake a whole yeare in weeping, but at length the Lord Jeſus had mercy upon mee, ſhewed mee his wounds, with which the wound of my conſcience in a moment was cured, and hee gave mee alſo the revelation of the Holy Spirit, and commanded that I ſhould declare unto others the grace ſhewed to me, and exhort them to repentance;
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:169711:179"/> which I have done this foure yeares, and will doe as long as my life ſhall laſt. I know truly, that the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed world doth endeavour to take away my life, but I am prepared to die, becauſe by my death I ſhall glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie Chriſt. Hee declared alſo, that when hee did call upon God in the priſon of Zlonice, the Spirit of God anſwered him in his heart, and ſpake great things, which were not lawfull to be uttered; as alſo that he was taken upon high, above all the powers of this world, leſt there ſhould be any which might prevaile againſt him. As he had formerly declared all theſe things to the common people, ſo he did now declare them in priſon to the Jeſuites themſelves: if they did deſcend to controverſie about the Supper of the Lord, and about one Mediator, Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he did fitly quote Scriptures, and urged them ſtrongly: he did likewiſe denounce puniſhments to the perſectuors of Gods people, the ſeducers of ſouls, and Maſſe-prieſts. He foretold alſo the bringing back, and gathering to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of the flock of Chriſt, now ſcattered abroad by the wolves.</p>

In fine, when all theſe things did ſhew a ſpirit more noble, than that it ſhould be reſiſted, they took care that hee ſhould be brought to Prague, the tenth day of Auguſt, and upon the fourteenth day of the ſame moneth, they puniſhed him, and that in ſuch a manner as was a ſigne of a ſeared conſcience: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore morning light, the people not knowing of it, they
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:169711:180"/> commanded that hee ſhould be brought forth, and without the gates at the gallowes be beheaded, and quartered; the ſeverall quarters being as a ſight ſet in the high-wayes, as being the members of ſome wicked Malefactors.</p>

Lucas</hi> the Jeſuite, the twenty fourth of December died, and there was in that place a moſt deep grave prepared for him, there was found at the bottome a certaine bedde of brick, which being plucked out, there appeared pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified bones with two cups, one of braſſe, and the other of Waxe, uncorrupted, and a piece of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maske cloth, the Reliques of his Prieſtly covering, long red hairs ſtuck ſtill to his skull. Theſe bones being gathered together, they brought them in a bas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket into the Veſtry, untill they did know what their Superiour would command concerning them: but what was afterwards done with them, we doe not know, but what we do declare, was related to us by an eye-witneſſe. So <hi>Rokizane</hi> having laine in his Sepulcher about 159 years and 7 moneth (for he died <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="8">8. At Trebovea there were extant ſome ſtony Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of ſome dead Paſtors, in the Church-yard, the eyes
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:169711:183"/> of which a Ieſuite beat out with his mallet, hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe blind, blinded thoſe that were before blind.</p>
               <p n="9">9. But yet their fury did not onely expreſs it ſelfe againſt thoſe that were already buried, I will not mention how they did deny them an honeſt buriall in the Church-yards, and forced them to bee buried in fields, gardens, high-wayes, and in thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that were ſet apart for the puniſhment of rogues. Certainly this was too barbarous that they did alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether deny, that ſome ſhould bee brought out of their houſes, and reſtored to our common mother the earth, for this onely end, that they might vomit out their hatred againſt thoſe that ſlept in Chriſt, and that they might deterre the living almoſt killed with the ſtink of their carkaſes, from the imitation of their conſtancy, this happened to a moſt holy man, <hi>John Mathrada Muſlen,</hi> preacher at Kutiberg, at Saint Barbera, who dying at his own houſe (in the yeare 1625 the 4. of October, who being privily returned from baniſhment departed;) the Arch-Deacon <hi>Api<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> denied altogether that he ſhould be buried, not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering himſelf to be wrought upon either by intreaties or by offers of money; at length after eight days, ſome good men by ſtealth taking away his carkaſſe in the night time buried it in a certaine place.

               <p n="10">10.

Who although he ſtirreth up wicked men to chaſtiſe his Church, yet nevertheleſſe he uſeth ſeverely to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them (after his paternall premonitions to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them) when behaving themſelves obſtinately exceeding the meaſure of cruelty, they become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigible. Wee ſhall touch upon ſome of this ſort.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The firſt forewarnings, were diverſe ſtrange ſights which appeared in heaven and earth. As for example the miraculous bow ſeen at Prague, by all, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the hour of execution: yea, ſuch amazement ſeized upon the people, looking thereon, before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution was ended, that they fled by troops from the place of Judicature into the ſtreets, no man pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing them or declaring the cauſe thereof. Fiery tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches alſo were ſeen in the night, environing the Martyrs heads which were ſet upon the tower, and a ſinging heard. Certaine of the Watchmen did confidently averre it; but for our parts in regard we were not
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:169711:184"/> eye-witneſſes) we leave it undetermined. But this is certaine that many ſuns were diverſe times ſeen, in the year following, the ſun alſo was ſeen by a great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of people at Prague, to dart out, as it were, balls of fire.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In the year 1623. exceeding thick ſmoak did proceed at ſet times from the pinacles of the chiefe Church of the Goſpellers at Joyfull Court ſo that men ſuppoſing it to have come from fire within, ran thither to quench the burning; but the Towers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well ſearched within, they found it otherwiſe. The Ieſuites becauſe they could not deny the truth of the miracle ſo often repeated, did interpret it to their own advantage, ſaying, the reliques of hereſies do now ſmoak and fly up into the air.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In the ſame year when upon <hi>Corpus Chriſti</hi> day, the firſt ſolemn circumgeſtation (or carrying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout) of holy bread, was celebrated at <hi>Kutterberge,</hi> with the noiſe of Trumpets, Timbrels, Fiddles, Gunnes, and the like, the Heavens (the Clouds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing compacted on a ſuddain, poured out ſuch a floud of waters, that within half an hour, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants-ſhops, Carts, and other heavy bodies, did ſwimme in the ſtreets, which alſo was mingled with ſo great a ſhower of haile, that not onely the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes of Churches and houſes were broken, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the ſheep in the fields, and the wild beaſts in the woods, were knocked downe, ſome wounded, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſlain.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="356" facs="tcp:169711:185"/>5. In the yeare 1624. in <hi>Autumn,</hi> a flying Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, flaming horribly was ſeen throughout all Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia and Sileſia. And that this was no whit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a miracle, we may gather from hence, becauſe in the ſame day and houre (about Sun-ſetting) it was obſerved in ſo many and remote places, that our faith could ſcarce elevate it ſelf ſo high to credit it, if it were not confirmed by a thouſand wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In the ſame year at <hi>Podebrade</hi> bloud flowed out for a whole moneth together (the ſpring neare the high-way being broken up.) Which ſome have uſed as a Rubrick (and to beget the more credit) have writ the ſtory thereof with that very bloud. Nor perhaps ought wee to omit that which theſe eyes have ſeen in the ſame year: Vpon the City-gate of Chrudim, the Armes both of the King and Queene were painted, with a diſtich written in Golden let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Theſe were thrice at leaſt drawne over with Chalk ſince the Emperors victory: and all the reſt being quite blotted out, onely the name <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke</hi> at ſeverall times became extant and legible by all.</p>
               <p n="7">7. In the yeare following 1625. neare Beneſlow, then in the Dominion of <hi>Paul Michna,</hi> a Fiſh-pond was wholly turned into bloud; for the ſpace of three dayes, as alſo it happened in other places at other times. In the confines of Moravia and Sileſia great
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:169711:185"/> flocks of Crowes and Dawes, flutted up and down; which at length by a great fight continued for a whole dayes ſpace, ſuffered a great diſtruction at the village of Bartoſchowitz, neare Fulnek; and indeed with other ſucceſſe then could bee expected; for the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker part overcame the ſtronger, ſome thouſands of the Crowes being faſtened in the Dawes-bills, fell and periſhed, without the ruine of ſcarce any of the Dawes. The Country-men alſo running to behold this ſpectacle, filled their ſackes with Crowes.</p>
               <p n="8">8. In the yeare 1626. at Prague it rained Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, and not long after the Image of the Crucifixe ſet up at Waltave-bridge, was ſmitten and throwne downe by a Thunder-bolt. In the ſame place Kutterberg-gate opened of its owne accord, the poſt being removed for two or three nights, to the great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhment of the Watch-men; which they were forced to averre upon oath. The like wonder was ſeene at Proſtanne in the City of Lichtenſteini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.</p>
               <p n="9">9. It cannot be deſervedly ſpunged out of the catalogue of miracles, that which we know happened to the Bibles at Zatek, in that they could not be bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. For when in the year 1630 the Books long before carried out of that City, by the joint authority of the Magiſtrates, were condemned and ſentenced unto the fire by the Commiſſaries, and kindled with
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:169711:186"/> wood-ſtacks piled in order without the walls, upon an hill near the water-courſe: the ſacred Bibles of <hi>Simeon Swoboda</hi> (all other books being conſumed) ſuffered the flames without harm (ſaving onely that their margins were ſomewhat ſinged) as alſo an other book of Eccleſiaſticall Pſalms, of an old Edition, both whereof are preſerved for a memoriall by the Exuls of Zateck, at Friburg.</p>
               <p n="10">10. God alſo the revenger of wickedneſſe, did ſometimes put forth a ſigne of wrath and indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt ſome in the very act of their villanies. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Apoſtates, driven and tormented by the ſting of conſcience, cried out, that they were damned; others not ſuffering the torment of conſcience, did hang or drown themſelves. And amongſt others that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding rich Merchant at Prague, <hi>Hans de White, John Campan</hi> the famous Poet (who after hee had changed his religion) thus ſaid to his wife, <hi>this day ſalvation is come to our houſe:</hi> whereto ſhe anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>this day a curſe is brought into our houſe.</hi> hee ended his life in deſpair. <hi>Daniel Baſil</hi> profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour in the Univerſity of Prague, was ſurprized with ſudden death. <hi>Iohn Chytraeus</hi> Paſtor at Slawko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wia, in Moravia, as hee was ready to recant and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure the Doctrine of the Goſpell in the Church, hee was ſtrucke dumbe: and from thence was carryed home, being poſſeſſed with an horrible trembling all over, and gnawing his tongue, at laſt, he died of unknown griefs.</p>

Doctor <hi>Daniel Knapper,</hi> a publick profeſſor of injuries againſt the Goſpellers (under pretence of juſtice and right) was ſlain by the ſuborning of his wife, an Adulterer, who afterwards was hanged and periſhed. <hi>Thomas Hrich</hi> was created Conſul at Rokyſan, for his example of Apoſtacy given to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: but within one year after (upon Michael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas-day) as the other Dragon, the hater and accuſer of the Brethren, being caſt down from off the Throne of pride, he vomited up his ungodly ſoul with bloud.</p>

               <p n="13">13. <hi>Florianus Libochovius,</hi> the Governour of the Horazdovian Dominion, a perverſe Apoſtate, a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayer of the Citizens, ſhot himſelf to death with a piſtol bullet. <hi>Hodina,</hi> a Citizen of Czaſlavia, but a

               <p n="13">13. A certain novice Church-warden, very wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and audacious in defacing the Churches of Lito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merzicium, digged out the bottome of a ſtone Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, above Lawrence-houſe-gate, ſhortly after hee fell into a ſharp diſeaſe. For accuſing himſelf of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, he tore his cloathes from off his body, pulled off his hair, not ſuffering his wife or any other to come near him, although for horrour and ſtink none could come to him. At length after that he had belch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up an incredible torrent of bloud, through his wicked throat, he was choaked by his own bloud, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an utter enemy to the bloud of Chriſt. When this was known to the whole City, there was no man (no not the Maſon) though of the Popes faction, (being terrified with this freſh example) which would ſo much as touch the marble Chalice, all guilded over found in the entrance of the other Church of <hi>Al-ſouls,</hi> (laid up in the wall of the larger Tower) in the year 1485. and afterwards trimmed up, which alſo was adorned with this inſcription, <hi>Veritas vincit.

<pb n="361" facs="tcp:169711:187"/> whom they called out of priſon: and gave him promiſe to ſet him at liberty, and give him his life, if he would take the Chalice out of the wall, and break it in pieces.

At length fearing to be prevented, he aroſe, and made haſt to the walls of the Tower, and commanded the Engineer to diſcharge ſeven Canons, and the eighth he would diſpatch himſelf; he therefore took the Pearch, and gave fire. But oh the terrible judgement of God! the Gun brake aſunder, and the ſplinters retorted upon him, which tore both his legs, both his thighs, the one arme, the one ſide, and in fine, took away the skull of his head. This was the reward which this unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py man received from divine vengeance, for his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery and tyranny. But the miracle was the greater, for that none of the ſtanders by (being fourteene in number) were hurt, or ſo much as touched, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onely a certain old hunter, whom he thruſt out by force beyond the Bulwark, to be received by the Guns, if they had fallen into the bottom: but his girdle ſticking upon a pale which was ſet in hurdles for a protecting basket filled with earth) did preſerve him from falling, untill ſhouting out for help, he was drawn up and ſaved by thoſe which were there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. This he afterwards related to the Prince, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a priviledge, that he ſhould not be compelled to forſake his Religion. Surely this was an evident ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of divine vengeance: yet notwithſtanding, blind men attributed this, even as all others, not to divine

               <p n="17">17. <hi>George</hi> of Machod, Auditor and Patron of the Brethren in Moravia from his youth, afterwards (from a Noble-man being made a Count) he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a moſt perverſe Apoſtate (who buried holy Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles in ſtinking channels, as we have noted in the chapter immediately preceeding) and was puniſhed by God after a miraculous manner, with a terrible diſeaſe in his throat, whereby his tongue putrified, and many holes were eaten out below his chin: ſo that whatſoever nouriſhment or medicines entred into his mouth, did either ſtraightway flow forth, or diſtilled out by little and little. All remedies therefore being uſed in vaine, after his ſuffering cruel torments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two moneths ſpace, he breathed out his ſoul, which was moſt unſteadfaſt, and ſold to Antichriſt, for the ſmoak of honour.</p>

               <p n="1">I. SO ſoone as the Popes ſword began to prevail, there were found ſome learned Doctors of the Church who did publickly and privately, by their Sermons and writings, admoniſh and ſtrengthen the hearts of the people, againſt thoſe tempeſts of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution which they apprehended comming, <hi>but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God ſcarce at any time makes his way through the ſtormes and whirle-winds</hi> (Nah 1.3.) but at the ſight of his wrath, the very mountaines are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered and the rockes are daſhed in pieces (1. <hi>King</hi> 19.11.) ſo likewiſe it happened here, that ſome of the Pillars of the Bohemians were overthrown, to wit
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:169711:191"/> the greateſt part of the Nobility and ſome part of the Miniſtery with the Generall ruine of all the people whereupon they rejoyced and were glad, who ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the inheritance of the Lord, <hi>becauſe ye were glad becauſe ye rejoiced O ye destroyers of mine inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, becauſe ye are growne ſat as the Heifer at graſſe, and bellow as bulls.</hi> But how the Glory of God and mans ſalvation was promoted by this is not knowne, nor can ſufficiently bee lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For becauſe in ſo great a number of Apoſtates from the Goſpell, there were ſcarce any who were perſwaded within themſelves that way which they were commanded to follow, was the true way of ſalvation, but meerely out of the fear of men, or elſe to pleaſe men, or ſome other blind and brutiſh inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, moſt of them followes the example of the reſt, and offered violence to their conſciences, and ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooke the truth; what can wee determine otherwiſe concerning the whole root then to ſay with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet (Iſaiah 1.4.) <hi>a ſinfull nation, a people laden with iniquity, a ſeed of evill doers, children that are corrupters, they have forſaken the Lord, they have provoked the holy one of</hi> Iſrael <hi>unto anger, they are gone backward.</hi>

But to ſpeak more mildly, what gain is it that you ſhould force men thus to lie. Do you believe that all thoſe whom you have compelled to profeſſe your Catholick Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, are really yours?</hi> Pray take away from one part, your gold and your temptations, from the other your ſwords, your racks, and other inſtruments of cruelty, and reſtore liberty of conſcience, and you ſhall preſently ſee, how ſeriouſly they have imbraced your religion, if therefore he be a falſe friend who loves another mans eſtate, and not his perſon, why are you ſo fooliſh as to pleaſe your ſelves in the thoughts of thoſe men, who either out of flattery, or elſe through force, ſeem to comply with your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent proſperous eſtate? The Babylonian pride induces you, that men ſhould be either inticed or forced by any means, to worſhip this your golden Image of the people, <hi>and that all nations and tongues ſhould fall down before the ſound of your pipe, your harp, and of your violl, and of all other muſicall instruments.</hi> Whileſt you intoxicated with the wind of fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, may ſecurely and jocondly dance amongſt the

               <p n="4">4. Yet there was ſomething good in theſe mens madneſſe, as it was ordered by the wiſdome of him, in whoſe hands all Tyrants are but as a Fanne, to cleanſe the graine of his Church: for by this meanes the chaffe was ſeparated from the wheat, and the droſſe from the gold, that now it might appear who loved Chriſt, and all hypocrites might be diſcovered. We certainly have ſeen, as in a glaſſe, ſomething which doth preſage that which the Lord foretold ſhould come to paſs when he comes, <hi>That there ſhould be two in one bed, one ſhould be taken, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould be left: two in one Mill, the one taken, the other left.</hi> Here it was apparent what was the ſtrength of them that truly love God, and what was the weakneſs of them that diſsemble godlineſs. For I will not reckon up what friends were ſeparated from their friends, what kinsfolk from their kinsfolk, parents from their children, children from their parents, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and ſiſter one from another: yea, ſome wives, their husbands not enduring the tryal of the Croſs, was ſeparated and disjoyned: ſome husbands are baniſhed, whoſe wives could not be perſwaded to forſake all for Chriſt: there are ſome women, who that they might profeſs their faith in Chriſt, have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:169711:193"/> their husbands for their Apoſtacy. <hi>Thy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (O Lord) are very deep.</hi> Pſam. 36.</p>
               <p n="5">5. But what ſhall we do with thoſe that they had ſeduced, whom the fear of this burning Babylonian furnace, had forced to fall down, and worſhip this Antichriſtian Idol? We muſt do as Paul did, who was much in ſorrow, and was grieved at the heart for the Brethren, who carried themſelves ſo, as to become forſakers of God: and we may hope, that Gods mercy will not be wanting to his Elect, in bringing them into the wayes of repentance. But becauſe God is a juſt Judge, and hath aſſigned a portion to <hi>the fearfull and liars in a lake of fire and brimſtone.</hi> [Rev. 21.8.] Now what will become of thoſe hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, who deny that with their mouths, that which they believe in their hearts; but fearfull, and lies in the ſight of God. God hath denounced the cup of his eternall wrath to all thoſe who have taken the mark of the Beaſt, either upon their fore-head or on their hands, that is, have joyned themſelves to the Beaſt, either by their profeſſion, or by their works. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14 9. It is moſt certain, that theſe are in a more dangerous ſtate than many will beleeve, <hi>Since it is ſcarce poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that thoſe who have been once enlightened, and taſted of the heavenly gift, and have been made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the Holy Ghoſt, and have ſavoured of the good word of God, and the power of the world to come, if they fall away, to be restored to repentance:</hi> Heb.

But ſince this is the condition of our countrey in general, we may cry out with the Prophet, <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the Lord had left us a very ſmall remnant, wee ſhould have been as Sodome, and we ſhould have been like unto Gomorra,</hi> Iſa. 1.9. by whom the field of Gods Church in Bohemia being planted again, might yeeld an acceptable harveſt to God: for there were many went away, who had rather cleave to Gods Worſhip, than to flatter <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> and by their filthy Idols break their Covenant with God, and of theſe there are above twelve thouſand.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Among the Nobility and Knights, in the year 1630. according to compute calculated as exactly as could be, there were found in baniſhment, 185 fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, which had gone out out of Bohemia, and each family 1.2.3.10.20. yea, there were found unto 50. male perſons, as in the families of <hi>Caplirzor, Gerſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ref,</hi> and <hi>Keblor.</hi>

And by Gods mercy, there was a good part of the Miniſtery found (but I doe not know how to give you a juſt account of them) among all the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, I am certaine, that about 200, who were alive in the year 1620, in Bohemia, and in Moravia, there were alive about 96, the reſt, in the ſpace of 10 years, either by ſword or peſtilence, or diſeaſes contracted by frights, and cold, or famin, or priſon had deſtroyed.</p>

                  <pb n="373" facs="tcp:169711:194"/>9. The towns-men and trades-men of Cities and towns, went away, in ſome places more, in ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces fewer: yea, among the very Country-men, and Husband-men there were not a few, who followed the reſt, and forſook the Country.</p>
               <p n="10">10. The greateſt part placed the ſeat of their abode in their abſence from their Country, in the Duke of Saxonies Dominions in Miſnia, in Luſalia, in Voit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and there was not a ſmall number, that betook themſelves to the protection of the Duke of Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bac, and the Marquis of Berruteis; ſome betooke themſelves in Marquis Brandenburgs Country, yea, even into Holland it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="11">11. They that went into Poland, found for their friend, the moſt Illuſtrious Count <hi>Belzenſis,</hi> the Lord <hi>Ralph</hi> Count de Loſſnia, who in their Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of Loſſnia, Wlodavia and Baronavia, friendly entertained above 1000, and protected them from the cruelty of their Enemies. The towns Oſtrorog, Roki, (under the government of the moſt Illuſtrious, the Counties of Oſtrorog, and the moſt Potent Lord <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colas Ray</hi> of Naglowitz's) as alſo Kobillium, under the Lord <hi>Abraham Szenintaw;</hi> and laſt of all, Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runium, an Empire City of Boruſſia, was a receptacle to very many, to whom the moſt Illuſtrious Prince, <hi>Christopher Rodzivillius,</hi> behaved himſelf very boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully, in relieving the miſery of their baniſhment, as alſo other pious people, whoſe hearts the Lord ſtirred up.</p>

                  <pb n="374" facs="tcp:169711:195"/>12. In Hungaria the Lord ſtirred up the heart of the moſt illuſtrous <hi>George Rakozius</hi> now Prince of Tranſilvania, to make his Dominions of Puchovia and Ladneſeus as a ſanctuary to the baniſhed, whether al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſome went from it ſelf, as alſo to the Dominions of Count Trurion, Count Eleshazius, the Lord <hi>Revius</hi> and others.</p>
               <p n="13">13. In Sileſia under the Government of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror God ſtrengthened the heart of <hi>Iohn Christian Duke</hi> of <hi>Briggs,</hi> that he durſt rather obey God than men, who entertained in his Duchy many of the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed Bohemians and Moravians, to whom, as alſo to the reſt under the heat of the day: Iſajah 16.3.4.5. <hi>Take counſell, execute judgment, make thy ſhadow as the night, in the midst of the noon day, hide not the outcasts, bewray not him that wandereth, let mine outcasts dwell with thee,</hi> Moab <hi>be thou a covert to them from the ſpoiler,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Beſides thoſe before named, who ſhunned Apoſtacy by their baniſhment, <hi>In very Bohemia it ſelf, and Moravia, ihe midst of theſe abominations, God reſerved to himſelf more than</hi> 7000, <hi>who did not bow their knees to Baal, nor kist him with their mouth.</hi> I do not mean Infants, who cannot diſtinguiſh between their right hand and their left: but men of growth, who in many places, under moderate Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, did not undergo ſuch a bitter perſecution as the other, but kept conſtantly in the faith: as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:169711:195"/> many in the Dukedome of <hi>Fridland,</hi> in the County of <hi>Weſtineus,</hi> of which we ſpake before, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Barons of <hi>Zerotin</hi> and <hi>Waldſtein,</hi> and ſome others, who ſuffered not their Subjects to be ſo tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented.

               <p n="15">15. Finally, we know many of thoſe who Apoſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed do with <hi>Peter,</hi> bitterly bewaile their fall, and do teſtifie it by their letters to their ejected Miniſters, yea and ſome of them that have the benefit of Miniſters, and a Miniſtery, have re-united themſelves, unto the Church; others with great deſire and anxiety of heart, do wait for the time of their freedome, ready upon the leaſt occaſion to be reconciled to God and the Church; and therefore more fervently then the reſt they do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore Gods mercy, and they do importune heaven with their teares and ſighs mitigating their loſſes with a reſolute hope, and expecting the Lord to come with ſuccour to them.</p>
